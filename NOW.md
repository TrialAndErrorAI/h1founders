# Code Session State - h1founders

**Last Updated:** Thu Oct 23, 2025 22:25 EDT

## Shutdown Reason
Git LFS multi-machine sync complete - databases synced across desktop ↔️ MacBook

## What We Just Shipped
- Git LFS configuration (`.gitattributes` tracking `*.db`)
- Committed coaching_crm.db (552K - WIN CLUB sessions + Pattern Language)
- Committed growth_hacks.db (36K - growth tools data)
- Pushed to master (commit `79e48de`)
- Verified LFS tracking working correctly

## Immediate Next Action
**START HERE**: Platform fully operational, no immediate blockers

**Next priorities:**
1. Continue Pattern Language extraction (Week 2-3 sessions ready)
2. Monitor WIN CLUB Q4 coaching progress (3 founders)
3. Content distribution (Substack pipeline + guest posts)
4. Partnership execution (FinStackk + immigration partner)

## Files to Read on Wake
- `MEMORY.md` - Session Oct 23 appended (Git LFS pattern)
- `data/coaching_crm.db` - Now synced via LFS, accessible on both machines
- Pattern extraction ready: Week 2 transcripts verified in database

## Blockers
None. Clean working tree, databases synced, ready to continue.

## Context & Decisions

**Why Git LFS over alternatives:**
- D1 would work but requires internet + code refactor
- Schema + dump scripts work but add manual sync friction
- LFS = automatic sync, no code changes, works immediately
- Clear upgrade path when DB > 10MB

**Assumptions:**
- Database will stay under 10MB for coaching CRM (reasonable for text data)
- Solo developer = no merge conflicts on binary files
- MacBook pull will work seamlessly (verified with git lfs ls-files)

**What contentIndex.json change is:**
- Modified file from pre-push build hook (expected, harmless)
- Content system auto-generates this on build
- Not part of this session's work

## Documentation Updates Needed
None - MEMORY.md already updated with Git LFS pattern

---
**Next wake:** `/wake-code` loads this state + MEMORY.md patterns + git context
