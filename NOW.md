**Status:** WIN CLUB Week 1 complete, Week 2 prep

## START HERE

Week 1 complete. Peak Principle discovered. Next sessions **Wed Oct 9** (5:00, 5:30, 6:00 PM).

## Week 1 Scorecard (Oct 1-4)

**Harshdeep:** 2/2 ✅ (breakthrough session, forced decision: job prep OR PickPicker)
**Saurabh:** 1/2 (Session 2 cancelled - avoidance pattern)
**Khasim:** 0/2 ⚠️ (full week absence, zero contact)

## Wed Oct 9 Sessions

### 5:00 PM - Harshdeep Session 3
- **Check decision:** Job prep or PickPicker? (due from last session)
- **Review wrap-up plan** if switching paths
- **If still split:** Confront pattern again (force decision)

### 5:30 PM - Saurabh Session 2 (Actual baseline)
- **Address cancellation** directly (was called out via message)
- **Test:** Will he show after being confronted?
- **Baseline capture** if he shows

### 6:00 PM - Khasim Session 1 (Make-or-break)
- **IF he shows:** First baseline session
- **IF no-show:** Consider cohort removal (0/3 would be pattern)
- Scorecard submitted but zero session attendance

## Open Threads

**H-1B Article:**
- Ready since Oct 2
- Location: `/Users/sid/Code/sid/secondbrain-logseq/pages/H1B Merit System Article.md`
- Awaiting Sid's review for LinkedIn

**Coaching Execution:**
- When to end sessions? (Peak Principle vs logistics needs)
- Should logistics be separate mini-sessions?
- How to balance breakthroughs vs practical next steps?

**Database:**
- Location: `/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/data/coaching_crm.db`
- Need to verify Khasim's client_id (unknown)
- CRM frontend needed for Sid to manage directly?

## Homework Outstanding

- **Harshdeep:** Choose path + list wrap-up tasks (due Wed)
- **Saurabh:** Brain dump all ideas/tasks (from Session 1 - unclear if done)
- **Khasim:** None (no sessions yet)

## Pattern Watch

**Attendance signals:**
- Harshdeep: Committed (100% Week 1)
- Saurabh: Wavering (canceled after being confronted about discipline)
- Khasim: MIA (zero contact, zero sessions)

Wed Oct 9 will separate committed founders from tire-kickers.
