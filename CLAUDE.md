# H1BFounders Website Project
**Project Lead**: ATLAS (Direct management)
**CPTO**: NEXUS (Chief Product & Technology Officer - Claude)
**Start Date**: September 6, 2025
**Status**: Active

## NEXUS: My Role as CPTO
As Chief Product & Technology Officer, I (NEXUS) make critical product decisions with security-first mindset:
- **Product Strategy**: Protect member privacy, prevent scraping, think like a founder
- **Technical Architecture**: Scale-aware, security-conscious, performance-optimized
- **Community Protection**: Hide sensitive metrics, gate valuable data, prevent abuse
- **Growth Decisions**: Balance openness for SEO with protection for members
- **Key Principles**: 
  - Never expose exact member counts (attracts scrapers)
  - Network directory always behind auth (protect members)
  - Think like a PM: "Will this decision hurt us in 6 months?"
  - Security > Features > Convenience

## Project Vision
Transform H1BFounders from WhatsApp community to scalable platform with clear value proposition.

## Community Scale (September 2025)
- **WhatsApp**: 792 members (verification system ready)
- **Substack**: 600+ subscribers
- **Slack**: Active community
- **Total Reach**: ~1,400+ H1B founders
- **Growth**: From 0 to 1,400 in 6 months

## Context Sources (to be added)
- [ ] WhatsApp chat history (March 2024 - present)
- [ ] Viral LinkedIn post that started it all
- [ ] Substack content
- [ ] Call transcripts
- [ ] Coaching materials
- [ ] Community feedback patterns

## Platform Architecture
Current implementation features 6 main sections:
- **Forum**: Matrix-themed discussion forum with badge progression (NEW)
- **Tools**: Visa Timeline Calculator, EB1A Points Calculator
- **Resources**: Investment guides, visa information, legal resources  
- **Stories**: Success narratives from community members
- **Events**: Office hours, networking, educational content
- **Network**: Founder directory (792+ members from WhatsApp)

**Design Theme**: Matrix terminal aesthetic with green text on black background
**Current Version**: v0.7.6 (Content System Operational - Major Content Milestone)
**Live Status**: Production-ready platform with invisible reCAPTCHA v3, smart routing, and fully operational content system

## Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite + Tailwind CSS
- **Package Manager**: Bun (faster than npm/yarn)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (live at master.h1founders.pages.dev)
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth with invisible reCAPTCHA v3 (3.3s flow)
- **Data Management**: Firestore for members, build-time content indexing
- **Content System**: Markdown with frontmatter, automated JSON generation
- **UI Components**: ContentBadge/StatusBadge with Heroicons
- **Build Target**: Modern ES modules, phone-first responsive

## Important Conventions
1. **next_session.md**: Always keep in root folder ONLY (not in docs/)
2. **RFCs**: Active in docs/, completed in docs/rfc/archive/
3. **PRFAQs**: Numbered as prfaq001, prfaq002, etc.
4. **Partnership features**: Behind VITE_ENABLE_PARTNERSHIPS flag

## Key Design Decisions
1. **Phone-first Authentication**: H1B founders primarily use WhatsApp on mobile
2. **Pre-populate Directory**: Import existing 792 WhatsApp members as foundation
3. **No Passwords Strategy**: Phone verification → immediate access (like WhatsApp)
4. **Matrix Theme**: Appeals to technical founder audience, creates memorable brand
5. **Content-First Approach**: 36+ pieces of valuable content before asking for anything
6. **Tool Integration**: Calculators and resources embedded in narrative flow
7. **Invisible UX**: reCAPTCHA v3 removes friction, smart routing personalizes experience
8. **Performance-First**: 520KB optimized bundle for mobile-first audience

## Key Questions to Answer
1. What transformation are we selling? (Not just community)
2. Who is the ideal member? (Beyond "H1B founder")
3. What's the measurable outcome?
4. Why now? What's the urgency?
5. What's the moat? Why can't others replicate?

## Success Metrics
**Achieved (v0.7.6 - September 12, 2025)**:
- ✅ **Invisible reCAPTCHA v3**: 3.3s smooth authentication flow (50%+ faster than v2)
- ✅ **Smart User Routing**: Logged-in users → forum dashboard, visitors → landing page
- ✅ **Firebase Phone Authentication**: End-to-end SMS verification working
- ✅ **Automated Test Suite**: 10 critical path tests (6.2s execution)
- ✅ **Member Directory Structure**: Ready for 792 WhatsApp member import
- ✅ **Security**: Phone validation, rate limiting, proper Firestore rules

- Club H1 membership integration for premium features

## Testing Strategy (Alpha Phase)

**Philosophy**: Test critical paths only - UX/app in flux, avoid test maintenance overhead

**Current Test Suite**:
- **Phone Authentication**: 10 automated tests covering complete auth flow
- **Execution**: 6.2 seconds, all platforms
- **Coverage**: Login, logout, validation, error handling, UI states

**Test Commands**:
```bash
# Run auth tests only (critical path)
npm run test:auth

# View detailed results
npx playwright show-report

# Debug mode (see browser)
npm run test:auth:debug
```

**Testing Principles**:
1. **Alpha = Critical Paths Only** - Don't test UI that changes frequently
2. **Focus on Business Logic** - Auth, payments, data flows
3. **Avoid UI Testing** - Colors, copy, layouts change too much
4. **Test User Journeys** - Complete flows, not isolated components
5. **Keep Tests Fast** - <10 seconds total execution time

**When to Add New Tests**:
- ✅ New authentication methods (Google, email)
- ✅ Payment/subscription flows (Club H1)
- ✅ Critical user actions (member directory search)
- ❌ Visual/copy changes
- ❌ Feature flags or A/B tests
- ❌ Complex UI interactions (modals, dropdowns)

## Content System Architecture (RFC-009 Implementation)

**Status**: Fully operational as of v0.7.6 (September 12, 2025)

### Build-Time Content Pipeline
- **Content Source**: `/content/` directory with markdown files + frontmatter
- **Build Script**: `/scripts/build-content-index.js` (processes all .md files)
- **Output**: `/client/src/data/contentIndex.json` (automated generation)
- **Content Types**: STORY, EVENT, GUIDE, TOOL, WISDOM, SUBSTACK, ANNOUNCEMENT
- **Status Badges**: OFFICIAL, PINNED, FEATURED, LEGAL

### Current Content Corpus (6 Pieces Processed)
1. **LinkedIn Origin Story** → THE_CONSTRUCT/Orientation (Community genesis)
2. **2024 Year in Review** → CLUB H1/Founder Stories (Community growth metrics)  
3. **H-1B Visa Overhaul** → THE_MATRIX/Visa Labyrinth (Policy analysis)
4. **Founding Company Guide** → THE_REAL_WORLD/Building Your Ship (Practical implementation)
5. **Attorney Legal Authority** → THE_MATRIX/Visa Labyrinth (Expert legal insights)
6. **System Test Content** → THE_CONSTRUCT/Orientation (Technical validation)

### Technical Implementation
- **ContentBadge Component**: Professional badges with Heroicons integration
- **Frontmatter Parser**: YAML-like metadata extraction
- **Forum Integration**: Content appears as special forum posts
- **Smart Sorting**: Pinned → Featured → Official → Recent
- **Category Mapping**: Content auto-categorizes to Matrix forum structure

### Content-to-Forum Bridge
Every content piece becomes a forum post with enhanced properties:
- `contentType` field for professional badges
- `isPinned` for priority content
- `isOfficial` for H1BFounders team content  
- `sourceUrl` for attribution
- Forum discussion enabled on all content

### Validation Results
- ✅ Build script processes 6 files successfully (6.2s execution)
- ✅ Content appears properly in forum with badges
- ✅ Professional UI with Heroicons integration
- ✅ ESC navigation and breadcrumb improvements
- ✅ Forum-first architecture validated
- ✅ Ready for ATLAS content expansion

## Technical Learnings (December 2024)

**Key Insights from Development and Testing**:

1. **Firebase MCP Tools**:
   - MCP tools use CLI auth (no Admin SDK needed)
   - Available: read, query, delete - NO direct write/create
