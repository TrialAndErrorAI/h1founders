# H1BFounders Naming Strategy Discussion

## The Core Tension
- **H1BFounders**: Sticky, recognizable, emotionally charged, but limiting
- **H1Founders**: Broader, inclusive, cleaner, but loses specificity

## Current Assets
- **H1BFounders.com**: Already owned, pointing to Substack
- **Brand Equity**: 1,400+ members know "H1BFounders"
- **SEO/Recognition**: Built over 6 months

## Naming Options Analysis

### 1. Keep H1BFounders
**Pros:**
- Zero friction, existing equity
- Sticky and memorable
- Clear niche identity

**Cons:**
- Boxes in as community grows
- H1B stigma in US discourse
- Excludes O-1, EB-1, OPT founders

### 2. Pivot to H1Founders
**Pros:**
- More inclusive from day one
- Cleaner, professional positioning
- H1 can mean: High-skilled, <h1> header, High-impact

**Cons:**
- Risk losing search/brand recall
- Need to explain missing "B"
- Requires domain purchase/setup

### 3. Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
- Launch on **H1BFounders.com** (existing recognition)
- Also secure **H1Founders.com** â†’ redirect
- Homepage messaging: "Started as H1B Founders. Now home to all immigrant founders."
- Test resonance over 6-12 months
- Can flip primary domain later

## What "H1" Could Mean
1. **Literal**: Shorthand for high-skilled visas (H-1B, O-1, EB-1)
2. **Metaphorical**: <h1> = headline founders of the future
3. **Aspirational**: High-impact, High-intent, High-growth
4. **Ambiguous**: Let community define meaning (like YC, a16z)

## Domain Strategy
**Priority Domains to Secure:**
- h1founders.com (community, plural)
- h1founder.com (personal brand, coaching)
- h1founders.org (protection)
- immigrantfounders.com (future-proofing)

## Messaging for Transition
"We started as H1B Founders when one LinkedIn post went viral. Today, we're 1,400+ immigrant founders strong - from H-1B to O-1, OPT to EB-1. The visa doesn't define us. The ambition does."

## ATLAS Recommendation
1. **Launch with H1BFounders.com** next week (momentum > perfection)
2. **Secure H1Founders.com** now and redirect
3. **Test dual branding** for 6 months
4. **Let community usage guide** final decision
5. **Focus on value delivery** over naming debates

The name matters less than the transformation you're delivering: From visa-trapped employee to self-sponsored founder with EB1-A path.
