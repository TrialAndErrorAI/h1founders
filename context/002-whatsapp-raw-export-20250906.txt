Similar to Sid, I wanted to give back and help people so I created PermanentResident.us to enabled eligible applicants to request free immigration attorney consultations.
[3/26/24, 12:39:47 AM] ~ Lindsey: Instead of answering FAQ repeatedly, we have free videos with an immigration attorney https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvnrxWnA9_UuhEL1KGdNGdRTkNDSjmRHg&feature=shared

I’ve now graduated and have a job on my OPT (waiting to hear if I lucked out in the H1B lottery). I make social media content which has amassed over 20 million views and hope to build a business off the back of this audience in the USA, but my immigration status is obviously delaying this. I’m so excited to join this group as I’m sure many of you are in a similar position as I am!

I am very excited we were able to create this group out of the LinkedIn post. I will strive to dedicate time in here to share my own journey so far of living and working in the US for 15 years across multiple startups and various visa classes, to now be a founder.

[3/26/24, 6:50:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I was thinking a  good way to kick things off that helps everyone is by having a 1:1 discussion with few individuals. 
I would need one or two volunteers for the call (I will DM you privately to ask or any one of you feel free to let me know as well). We can then have a focused conversations about visa, immigration, entrepreneurship.. and generalize from there. 
Every one would be invited for the call and we can have chat open to all for questions and discussions. 

We can schedule a zoom conference in the coming days - either Thu or Fri this if it can work out. We can have a recurring calls with more folks and use this group chat for further discussion. Let's all be supportive and collaborative.

I encourage all of you to introduce yourself here - what you do, your journey thus far, your current predicament etc..

Thank you veru much @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ for creating this community and for proposing to organize calls to understand solutions for entrepreneurs like us.

I'm a founder in the US. Co-founded a Delaware C-Corp in the automotive industry.

I was on an H1B until the 31st December 2023 and my grace period ended on the 29th of February.

I've changed my status to B2 and I'm deciding if I should try for an eb2 niw or an O1 or an H1B.

Great article and thank you very much for sharing it. (https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/i-sponsored-my-own-h1b-visa-sid-sarasvati-ekxqc/) 

We're a startup in bootstrap mode, and our product is in early beta. I'm considering going full-time and applying for an H1B visa. 

My question is 
*How much do we need to show to the USCIS for“ Ability to pay the Salary” ?* Let's say my salary in the SF Bay Area is around $100,000. Do we need $100,000 in our bank account or $300,000 for the entire three-year visa validity?

[3/27/24, 1:54:03 PM] Girish: Hey Pandian,

I spent a lot of time and money this on lawyers to understand how to go about the H1b route. So I'll respond to your question with my summary notes 🙂

I request everyone else to pitch in on my answer 🙂
[3/27/24, 1:58:04 PM] Girish: We will need to have around 100K in the bank account (prevailing wage between L1 and L2 level + business development & other expenses).*this is the prevailing wage for an automotive engineer, which is who I am, Denver* This can be a loan from our family which we can return immediately upon H1B approval. There is no need to show any proof of where these funds came from. 

In offer letter, it can be mentioned that you will be paid only once a year at the end of the year (however, this is recommended only for the 1st year). This way we can return the money immediately after H1B approval and then work without pay until the end of the year and make some money. In 2026, USCIS will want to see proof that you were  paid the prevailing wage. 

Once you are  paid, you can route the money back to the company (we can put it in the operating agreement that this will be the case as well). 

To establish employer-employee relationship (one of the 3 options below)

1. We will need a board of directors with a formal **board agreement**. The board must comprise of engineers . The board agreement will stipulate that we release the board members of all liability. This board will control your salary & my employment status (hiring/firing)
2. You can structure the ownership 51/49 (you hve 49 and your partner has 51) which automatically gives your partner  the right to terminate your employment *this option is of course only valid if your partner is a us citizen, permanent resident, or does not reside in the US*
3. You can  have preferred voting rights in your operating agreement. This way you and your partner have 50/50 ownership but the partner's preferred voting rights mean that  he can control your salary & employment status.  

Listing out all your possible business leads & soft commitments will improve the chances of getting the H1B approved. 

Financials : 100K (fully returnable upon H1B approval), $14K for h1B application & transfer
[3/27/24, 1:58:55 PM] ~ Lindsey: Lindsey: Hello everyone, I am an ex-founder with an EB1-A green card. You can self sponsor your EB1-A green card. Similar to Sid, I wanted to give back and help people so I created PermanentResident.us to enabled eligible applicants to request free immigration attorney consultations.

[3/27/24, 2:22:30 PM] ~ Pandian Raja: Very valuable information and Thank you very much @⁨Girish⁩ 

So I need to take care of appropriately 120k USD and a board member who’s US citizen or permanent resident. 

Dang! I thought funding was hard to climb but Employee-employee relationship became Mount K2 for me. 
My co-founder is in STEM OPT and she started C-Corp on her name. Having said that I need to find a very good board member who’s US citizen or permanent resident. 

Thanks again Girish. I’ll update you’ll my progress very soon.
[3/27/24, 2:30:08 PM] Girish: Glad you found the info useful @⁨~Pandian Raja⁩ 😊
[3/27/24, 2:33:22 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “The board must comprise of engineers” 

That’s news to me Girish. Where did you hear this? 
There could be questions on having your spouse on board. But I do think everyone needs to be an “engineer”. Unless I’m missing the context How will USCIS even define it? ‎<This message was edited>
[3/27/24, 2:41:22 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I will add that the $$ is a bit subjective. What you have to prove is that business can continue to operate. 
So a solid business plan 
A pitch deck with financial numbers. 
And anything else - like investor meetings or awards etc helps boosts your case 

Only salary you must pay yourself prevailing wage for the title. This requirement is same of all typical H1B requirement. 

Also register your corp with dnb.com and get DUNS number. If you ever publish iPhone app you have to do it. 
I forgot the the name of database. There is one where USCIS will look for your company information. I’ll post it back here.

Got it. I’ll raise around $150k with my friends and family. I’ve just started applying to VC’s and received few startup credits from GCP, AWS. 
Yes, Apple forced me to get DUNS number for the App Store. 
I have got EIN number and need to get E Verify.
[3/27/24, 2:57:14 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I’m not sure about e-verify 
Can you share more on what you learned?
[3/27/24, 3:00:24 PM] ~ Pandian Raja: E-verify for my co-founder for her OPT Extension. She’s on STEM OPT and she needs our C-Corp to be E-verified for STEM Ext. She’s taking care of it. I don’t have much detail about it. I will ask her and let you know.
[3/27/24, 3:01:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I see ok. Yes. You need it for OPT. 

It’s not a requirement for H1B

The longer we wait, the longer it take achieve our goals. I’ve regret that I didn’t take risk earlier. 

Hope we all share the information and help each other.
[3/27/24, 3:07:36 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I am always inspired hearing stories. 

Business is a lonely endeavors at times. Add immigration complexity and we are out in helpless situation. It’s anyway hard to build conviction to risk it all for business. You add more doubts to the mind with immigration etc - it kills the spirit. 

I want to encourage everyone to discuss and share. I spent much of last 3 years alone figuring out all aspects of immigration and entrepreneurship. The internet didn’t help. 

We know this gets especially hard - almost impossible - for India and China born immigrants ‎<This message was edited>
[3/27/24, 3:08:53 PM] ~ Pandian Raja: For E-verify, my co-founder said it’s created online for free at everify gov and Yes, it’s for OPT Ext not for H1B.
[3/27/24, 3:13:40 PM] H1B Founders : ‎You changed the group description
[3/27/24, 3:28:05 PM] Girish: Hey Sid,

You're right. Not necessarily engineers. But what my lawyer said is that they need to be related to the industry you are operating in some capacity. It must make sense to USCIS that they are good candidates for your board 

I used the word "engineer" in my notes during the meeting with the lawyer and didn't change it. 
Thanks for catching it 🙂
[3/27/24, 3:30:52 PM] Girish: To further compliment what Sid said, the lawyer I spoke to had said that you can also show contracts with potential clients to show that you will receive money. 

So in case you can't raise the prevailing wage, you could possibly show these contracts. Not as strong as having the money in the account (according to the lawyer) but still a good option


But there is a risk here.. Apparently USCIS can verify if you had anything to do in securing those contracts (like possibly calling the customers up). and if you were involved and your visa was not appropriate (for example, if you were on an H4 or B2 visa while you were securing those contracts), you could be in trouble 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[3/27/24, 3:31:05 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I see ok. From pure government POV I don’t how they can enforce “good candidate” for board. 
I think this might mean - not having your spouse on the board to prove employer employee relationship. 
I had wondered myself I could add my father and wife on the board to prove H1B requirement. That wouldn’t work. 
But it can be anybody else.
[3/27/24, 3:31:41 PM] Girish: ❤
Almost broke down in Jan seeing how complex the situation was 

So glad you started this group @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩

[3/30/24, 2:43:09 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hi everyone, I’ll repost some of the earlier messages back again as many of you have joined the group in past few days. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/30/24, 2:43:47 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hi everyone, each one of us has an inspiring story. By sharing we make each other stronger with a sense of community. I get a lot of inspiration hearing each and every story.  
I am very excited we were able to create this group out of the LinkedIn post. I will strive to dedicate time in here to share my own journey so far of living and working in the US for 15 years across multiple startups and various visa classes, to now be a founder.
[3/30/24, 2:44:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I was thinking a  good way to kick things off that helps everyone is by having a 1:1 discussion with few individuals. 
I would need one or two volunteers for the call (I will DM you privately to ask or any one of you feel free to let me know as well). We can then have a focused conversations about visa, immigration, entrepreneurship.. and generalize from there. 
Every one would be invited for the call and we can have chat open to all for questions and discussions. 

We can schedule a zoom conference in the coming days - either Thu or Fri this if it can work out. We can have a recurring calls with more folks and use this group chat for further discussion. Let's all be supportive and collaborative.

I encourage all of you to introduce yourself here - what you do, your journey thus far, your current predicament etc..

[4/5/24, 2:51:56 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I found this helpful. The immigration terminology can get complex. It helps to be precise and to frame your problem as such when researching. 

Some terminology to know in U.S. immigration law -

-- Your "status" determines how long you can be in the US, and it is not the same as your "visa" which is the thing stamped into your passport by a US consulate.  Your "visa" might be expired but your "status" might be valid.  Your "status" is generally based on your I-94 admission record.

-- You generally need a valid "visa" to travel into the US to present yourself to a border officer (with various exceptions including for those lovable Canucks, at least most of them).

-- A "petition" is something that is filed on your behalf, so an employer might file an H-1B petition, or a spouse might file an I-130 petition, and an I-140 may be in some circumstances filed as a SELF-petition.  If it is a self-petition, then you are both the petitioner and beneficiary.  

-- For an H-1B petition, it is technically the employer's PETITION and you are the BENEFICIARY.

-- An application is a filing made by a specific person for himself/herself:  So an I-539 application is filed by H. Potter to extend his status or possibly change his status to F-1 to attend West Coast Hogwarts.  But an exception to the term "application" exists in the US Department of Labor (DOL) where a PERM labor certification APPLICATION is an application (not a petition), but it is filed by an employer.

-- So, if DOL were on the same page as USCIS, they would call it a PERM labor certification petition.  (But DOL is never on the same page as USCIS...)

-- As far as DOL goes, a Labor Condition Application ("LCA") is something relevant to an H-1B petition but a PERM labor certification application is relevant for a green card (permanent residence).  You will confuse people if you use the abbreviation LCA if you mean PERM.  

-- The term "change of status" means going from one temporary visa status to another, whereas the term "adjustment of status" means going from a temporary visa status to permanent resident status.

-- "Nonimmigrants" are people coming to the US temporarily and "immigrants" are people coming to the US indefinitely with a green card.

-- "Green card holder" is basically interchangeable with "legal permanent resident".  If someone uses the term "resident alien" - you should have your radar up that they are using a term from tax law and there are many "nonimmigrants" who are "resident aliens" for tax purposes.

[4/8/24, 8:24:49 AM] ~ Sam: I have did intensive research on this… but also do your due diligence with anything I share.. 

Anyone can start an entity in US regardless of your status (even from outside the US) but you cannot technically work for it unless the entity also has a h1 filing for you.

Company1: your main company that holds your h1b and has your i140 and others 
Company2: your own entity that you founded and has a secondary h1 

So, typically if you found a company/entity.. have someone work for you to manage it.. and you happily take the profits along with filing taxes.. 

But if you work for your company 2 (that you founded) and uscis finds  out that you are working for it without h1, you are inviting unnecessary trouble ‎<This message was edited>
[4/8/24, 8:28:10 AM] ~ Sam: So the caveat is, h1b holders are bound to have a h1 filing with all the companies that they are working for to legally claim anything.. including properly getting salary and filing taxes for this second h1..
[4/8/24, 8:37:40 AM] ~ Rohit Jain: I second that according to my research and talk with Immigration attorney

[4/8/24, 3:57:35 PM] ~ Supreet: What about folks who have an H1B and set up a new company and work “part time” on H1B for the new company?
[4/8/24, 4:02:00 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s a great question. It would be good to get a comprehensive perspective on this from all. 

From what I know you could. H1B is a US visa. So if you had a property in India and made profits from running a rental business this is not something USCIS can regulate. 

What’s interesting here is tax implications. You should look into that. You will have to pay taxes in US. 

Also - what do you mean by “working” for Indian business? Will you be on payroll? That’s a different than being an owner
[4/8/24, 4:04:06 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Remember one doesn’t have to on payroll to run the business. You can hire a CEO or managers.
[4/8/24, 4:04:41 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I setup my payroll for US business for the sole purpose of sponsoring H1B. Because I need to be an employee.
[4/8/24, 4:04:41 PM] ~ Rohit Jain: I mean opening a company under my name and then working on it. I don't want to hire managers or CEO for the beginning.
[4/8/24, 4:08:59 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You should do it. 
You will need your father or someone in India as director. Indian law requires a resident person. 

Let’s think about it another way - if someone in India already has a business with some % of equity. Say a family owned business. 

Will that make USCIS  not give them H1B visa? 

The problem is with the contract you sign with your employer. If they had a clause saying you need be full time with no moonlighting allowed. Then that contraints you. 

Also - you need to be careful about conflict of interest. 

All of this is legal stuff. Not specific to immigration or H1B 

Basically - any with working 2 full time jobs has to be ethical and careful is some ways ‎<This message was edited>

It’s a gray area. But it’s not that FBI is coming in to find all evidence of criminal activity 

You primary record is your tax returns. When you go for green card you submit your tax returns and they audit it. So that’s why you wanna avoid taking in money without proper setup

There can be compliance issues which we want to avoid but to be out of compliance is not what you categorize as “be caught”

[4/12/24, 2:31:18 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I think the question if EB2-NIW jumps the EB2 queue for Indian born petitioner. 
No it does not. EB2-NIW priority date is not current. But for those on H1B it is a good option.
[4/12/24, 2:41:30 PM] ~ Asif J: Would love to learn more on the feasibility of switching from H-1B to EB2-NIW, and if the acceptance threshold is lower than for EB-1
[4/12/24, 2:42:31 PM] Girish: Sorry should have given more context on my case.

I'm exploring this because I was born in Saudi Arabia.

Plus I'm working on the automotive industry so the lawyer thinks I have a good chance because it's sort of a specialist role
[4/12/24, 2:43:47 PM] Girish: Apparently there was a case called "Dhanasar" where the lawyers were able to prove that a person called Dhanasar who was working on things of national importance.

Since that case apparently NIW cases are getting approved for people with masters in stem working on unique things of national importance... Not just for people with PhD
[4/12/24, 4:13:55 PM] Sid Sarasvati: EB2-NIW not as comprehensive as EB1-A 
But you could go with EB2 as well if your employer can sponsor it. Lawyers do all the work there you have just provide basic info about you and job.

EB1-A is very different beast. It’s writing a book about yourself. And proving expertise to at least 3 out of 10 criteria defined by USCIS.

[4/13/24, 10:49:52 PM] ‪+1 (415) 932‑9664‬: Yes they can as per USCIS but most employers would wait a year, check performance and then initiate GC.

[4/13/24, 10:51:25 PM] ~ Shailja: Is this irrespective of your visa status?
[4/13/24, 10:52:13 PM] ‪+1 (415) 932‑9664‬: Yes,  GC is for future employment. It can be filed irrespective of visa status
[4/13/24, 10:52:34 PM] Sid Sarasvati: What specifically do you mean by ‘green card petitions’? 
Employers can file EB2 etc. But that doesn’t mean green card per say. It’s just makes you eligible you then need to file ‘Adjustment of Status’ if you want to green card.
[4/13/24, 10:54:41 PM] ~ Shailja: I meant I-140. Once it's approved, your h1B gets renewed for a lifetime.
[4/13/24, 10:55:33 PM] ‪+1 (415) 932‑9664‬: Does employer has to file h1b renewal every 3 years after i-140 is approved
[4/13/24, 10:57:16 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Gotcha. So I-140 is after you have had an H1B. 
Now back in 2010s.. we use to wait until the last few years of H1B expiry i.e 4 our 6 years to request the employers to kick start the process. 
Some companies will wait if you have years left on H1B so you need to convince them. Say “you need the priority date ASAP” 
Ideally you get your i140 sorted asap.
[4/13/24, 10:58:28 PM] Sid Sarasvati: So yes could be same year. They is no “cool down” period after you have an H1B for i140 filing. You can start immediately AFAIK.
[4/13/24, 10:59:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Here  by i-140 we mean EB2/EB3 petition.
[4/13/24, 11:01:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: EB1-A is self petition. You do not need anyone’s permission. You don’t even need an H1B. You don’t even need to be in the US. 
There is a lot of interest in this category. I’ll speak about this in our next call to share my own experience of winning this game.

[4/13/24, 11:17:33 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Was recently paid off. In the current job market it appears almost no one is sponsoring h1b. Spoke to a lawyer about eb1a. They mentioned to maintain status self sponsor h1b is now possible without having a board based on H1b modernization. Is this true? They also wanted over $6200+filling fee. Seems excessive! ‎<This message was edited>
[4/13/24, 11:55:38 PM] ~ Santanu: Other than Indian, people are preferred to file green card . As H1B is lottery based. But they can get GC before that.
[4/14/24, 1:14:20 AM] Sid Sarasvati: $6K sounds ok. 
Modernization of ‘H1B for Entrepreneurship’ has been proposed. 
It will make the 50%+ ownership OK. Although, this has not happened just yet. 
ASK the lawyer to cite their source. Where did they learn this? They should be able to provide this as USCIS guidelines are not private.
[4/14/24, 1:18:32 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Will email them. They said they have already had success with a "few" clients.
[4/14/24, 1:19:56 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s good news. 
Here is the news from USCIS 
https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/dhs-issues-proposed-rule-to-modernize-the-h-1b-specialty-occupation-worker-program
[4/14/24, 1:20:40 AM] Sid Sarasvati: This is the key line: 
“. Additionally, DHS would establish new H-1B eligibility requirements for rising entrepreneurs; and”
[4/14/24, 1:25:11 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Anyway - this will make the process easier i.e you could own 100% of company and not need a board maybe. This will also help entrepreneurs to come in directly to US from abroad as a founder - these are all guesses. We are yet to see how exactly USCIS make entrepreneurship easier. Regardless, this is what makes this group exciting. I don’t have high hopes for EB2 greencard backlog for Indians and Chinese. They will not fix that. But I believe becoming a founder on H1B is a legit path. Which then paves the way for EB1 green card. 

 The post I made on LinkedIn outlines the path that anyone can follow.

It’s a subjective thing. The case you are making is for having a business with purpose I.e it wasn’t started just for the sake for filing H1B 
You can understand how this can be used for scam. And there are many. So you wanna clear that bar. 

I had an app on AppStore with paying customers. 

What’s important is to show future growth plans with evidence - business plan, contracts, customers, and ability to pay the wage as listed in the petition

We will make this recurring - last Wednesday of each month. 
It’s will be open to all. 

We had a lot of interest into EB1-A after the first call so I will share my EB1 journey. There is a lot to unpack here. But if you are on EB2 and from India or China - you need to know this.

[4/17/24, 11:21:42 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Thank you. Please DM me.
[4/17/24, 11:23:56 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Hmm. 
What is your current visa? 
And have you had a chance to consult any attorney for advise? 
We can provide perspective and share knowledge on paths we have taken or have seen our friends do.

[4/17/24, 11:49:43 AM] ~ Mark: I would seriously encourage people to pursue an E2, the H1b ID fraught with challenges for people from India...
[4/17/24, 11:50:17 AM] ~ Mark: An E2 now can be obtained for $50k if done properly....
[4/17/24, 11:50:36 AM] ~ Mark: Those priority dates are a killer...
[4/17/24, 11:51:27 AM] ‪+1 (847) 691‑1159‬: What is E2?
[4/17/24, 11:51:27 AM] Sid Sarasvati: E2 requires a Treaty between your country and US. 
Unfortunately, India is NOT on the list.
[4/17/24, 11:52:01 AM] ‪+1 (253) 686‑9285‬: Is Nigeria on the list
[4/17/24, 11:53:04 AM] Sid Sarasvati: https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/e-2-treaty-investors

India does not have E2 treaty. 

I know Turkey does. My cofounder - @⁨Ercan Ozer⁩ is from Turkey. We looked this as an option from him to move from Canada (PR) to US. But it has some challenging requirement to have the business be owned 50% in Turkey etc. 
So O1 or H1B seemed better.
[4/17/24, 11:53:27 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Here is the E1/E2 Treat list

[4/17/24, 11:53:56 AM] ~ Mark: Oh my bad, I did not realize that !
[4/17/24, 11:56:33 AM] ~ Mark: H1b lottery is still very hit and mostly miss...it was such a painful path for me...
[4/17/24, 11:58:01 AM] ‪+1 (253) 686‑9285‬: Nigeria appears to have neither. What would that mean?
[4/17/24, 11:59:26 AM] ~ Saurabh Sharma: I guess that would mean Nigeria probably won’t qualify either.
[4/17/24, 12:02:02 PM] Sid Sarasvati: O1 is the alternative path 
It doesn’t need lottery 
But you need to make a case for extraordinary skills 

Not very hard if you are willing to work on it
[4/17/24, 12:06:44 PM] ~ Mark: I was one of the guys that got refused for "Specialty Occupation" and it was a complete joke....but know very little about the O.

I did it all on the H1b...MTR, Balca, lawsuit...all of it....so that I know extremely well...and it was full of pain for multiple years...
[4/17/24, 12:07:38 PM] ~ Mark: H1b is such a crippled tool...especially for our Indian friends.
[4/17/24, 12:09:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It terrible. It’s good for no one. Not even US.
[4/17/24, 12:09:52 PM] ~ Mark: Agreed.
[4/17/24, 12:10:09 PM] ~ Mark: I have had excellent lawyers too...
[4/17/24, 12:10:46 PM] ~ Mark: We got past it in the end...but what a horrible journey....I never felt safe for a single day.
[4/17/24, 12:11:44 PM] ~ Mark: The only thing good about a H1b is the dual intent....
[4/17/24, 12:12:22 PM] ~ Mark: The H4 process is also a huge problem for wife and kids aging out.....been there, done that too....
[4/17/24, 12:13:17 PM] ~ Mark: I will shut up now as I am here to help others...and interested in the H1b from an E2 company founder...my son...
[4/17/24, 12:15:23 PM] ~ Mark: One last question for you Sid.
[4/17/24, 12:16:20 PM] ~ Mark: Do you think that three Masters degrees, including an MBA, qualifies for an O1 ?
[4/17/24, 12:16:21 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Thanks for sharing. This is great. Maybe you can join the call on 24th and we can chat a bit. 
The online resources are confusing and flawed when it comes to immigration. So hearing personal journey is the best way for any one to gain insight.
[4/17/24, 12:16:50 PM] ~ Mark: I will definitely try....
[4/17/24, 12:17:16 PM] ~ Mark: I know the H1b process extremely well...
[4/17/24, 12:17:21 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes. In fact, you dont’ even need a degree. A degree is an H1B requirement. For O1 you need to prove your case to have done the work. Degree can add value but NOT required. This is why founders prefer O1. Not everyone has a masters degree.
[4/17/24, 12:18:38 PM] ~ Mark: I don't know what my son would have that qualifies as extraordinary ability ...just highly educated...
[4/17/24, 12:22:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The eligibility requirements are similar to that of EB1 visa - less strict though. There are 10 criteria and you have to win 3 out of 10.
A lot of this is making the case and developing the profile. I will cover this on our next call.
[4/17/24, 12:22:30 PM] ~ Mark: 👍

[4/17/24, 1:46:57 PM] ~ Mark: There is no legal requirement set by law.It simply has to be deemed "substantial" and "at risk".
Ours was indeed 96k, but it would have qualified even at $50.
[4/17/24, 1:48:10 PM] ~ Mark: It also helps if you have cash "on hand" over that amount, available to the business....meaning, you did not scrape it together....
[4/17/24, 1:48:33 PM] ~ Mark: The interesting thing here...is that it can even be borrowed funds...
[4/17/24, 1:49:15 PM] ~ Mark: It is also meaningful if the E2 beneficiary has over 50% of the equity....we did 70%.
[4/17/24, 1:51:43 PM] ~ Mark: We even issued stock certs for the owners, formed the acquisition Co, created by laws and articles if association... Sending the signal that we knew exactly how to run a business.
[4/17/24, 1:51:55 PM] ~ Mark: *of
[4/17/24, 1:53:21 PM] ~ Mark: My son also has three Masters including an MBA.
[4/17/24, 1:53:44 PM] ~ Mark: Not that education means much where immigration is concerned.
[4/17/24, 2:00:15 PM] ~ Khushboo: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ thank you for all the great info you share with us! I had question about the boatd that needs to be formed for one’s one company to be able to employ you. I understand they need to own at least 50% voting shares. But do they also need to have invested money or take profits from the company? Or could it just be an advisory board meant to vote on big decisions? Like I could give them board seats in return for consultation and strategic advice but not necessarily give them a ton of shares in terms of $$?

[4/18/24, 8:24:30 PM] ~ Abhishek Gupta: As per cis docs, you can be in US until decision. It was clearly mentioned there. I am also thinking of it, can I connect with you?
[4/18/24, 8:26:19 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: Sure, feel free to DM :)
It's my first time hearing about this/trying out, but I'll tell you everything I know.
[4/18/24, 8:43:52 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Yes you can
[4/18/24, 8:44:14 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: I plan to apply in the next few weeks as well
[4/18/24, 8:44:42 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Or self petition h1b
[4/18/24, 9:02:14 PM] ~ Mark: Self petition H1b???
[4/18/24, 9:13:20 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Apparently we can create our own LLC and have that LLC sponsor the H1B. The H1B modernization rules have a section around entrepreneurs which simplifies what we can do currently
[4/18/24, 9:14:13 PM] ~ Mark: Ah, yes, I am familiar with that one...new H1b rule...
[4/18/24, 9:14:54 PM] ~ Mark: Still subject to cap though so still need lottery...
[4/18/24, 9:15:55 PM] ~ Mark: So you would still need status from something else.....like E2.
[4/18/24, 9:16:21 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Yes or a O1
[4/18/24, 9:16:40 PM] ‪+1 (979) 326‑8200‬: As far as I know that has not been implemented by USCIS, only beneficiary centric process has been implemented
[4/18/24, 9:16:42 PM] ~ Mark: Yes...
[4/18/24, 9:17:31 PM] ‪+1 (415) 932‑9664‬: If someone is on h1b, can they create LLC and transfer h1b to LLC
[4/18/24, 9:19:53 PM] ~ Mark: BYW..that final rule should be effective e as of now...
[4/18/24, 9:23:48 PM] ‪+1 (669) 292‑8842‬: ‎‪+1 (669) 292‑8842‬ left
[4/18/24, 9:21:27 PM] ~ Mark: As long as you can show income to support the H1b and show control of Employee....I think that carries some details that will be challenging...
[4/18/24, 9:22:13 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Most lawyers also want over $6000 + filing fees. Also how a significant amount of cash in the account
[4/18/24, 9:22:24 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Plus potentially contacts as well
[4/18/24, 9:23:46 PM] ~ Mark: And safest route is unpaid independent board members...have to show employee control....
[4/18/24, 9:24:24 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Employee control goes away in the new rule which I am hoping gets published this month
[4/18/24, 9:24:46 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Only employer employee relationship is needed from my understanding
[4/18/24, 9:26:49 PM] Sid Sarasvati: In my experience hardest part is actually having a business 
Rest all is solvable 

So what does having a business mean? 

Customer - current or future potential contracts 
Business plan 
Pitch deck 
Show revenue 
bank balance 
Funding from friends and family
[4/18/24, 9:28:47 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Also - incorporating a business is easy 
But you need a vision and a plan 
And start something that is not just a shell entity to file visa in the eyes of USCIS
[4/18/24, 9:29:59 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hm tough 
Did you go through list of options that allows you to extend your stay 

Like B visa etc or tourist
[4/18/24, 9:31:40 PM] ~ Mark: Yeah being broke will not fly as a reason....
[4/18/24, 9:31:43 PM] ‪+1 (415) 932‑9664‬: Isn’t it better to file B visa. Costs only $150 and gives you 6 months stay
[4/18/24, 9:32:26 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Will be helpful if anyone has done it to share their experience
[4/18/24, 9:32:41 PM] ~ Mark: Just no work...usually a show stopper for most...
[4/18/24, 9:32:51 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Or enrolling for another masters
[4/18/24, 9:59:09 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: My options are:
1. EAD
2. B1
3. Go back to India, get a job and come back after the H1B is filed
[4/18/24, 9:59:19 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: Haven't considered masters
[4/18/24, 10:35:41 PM] ~ Subrah: One of my friend applied let me check.

[4/18/24, 10:38:44 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: CC EAD doesn't give you status. But opens up the job market for any work. You can adjust your status back to h1b or any other stair without leaving the counter
[4/18/24, 10:39:37 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Moving to B1/B2 you maintain status for 6 months but can't work. You can move back to h1b. But it's almost impossible to extend beyond 6 months
[4/18/24, 10:41:27 PM] ‪+1 (945) 213‑0782‬: Does the 6 months period start from the day change of status is applied or from the day it is approved?
[4/18/24, 10:53:16 PM] ~ Subrah: You filled CC EAD through an attorney right ? What he is saying,  whether you can stay until you get that approved .
[4/18/24, 10:54:43 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: Not 100% sure. You get an i94 with it
[4/18/24, 10:55:01 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: It's from the date it's approved
[4/18/24, 10:55:20 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: You can stay. The whole point of the EAD is to stay.
[4/18/24, 10:55:24 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: You can stay in the country until it's processed. That adds several months
[4/18/24, 10:55:40 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: I filed on my own😅
[4/18/24, 10:55:52 PM] ‪+1 (945) 213‑0782‬: Ok. If a new i94 is issued, then that might control the max allowed stay in US. That make sense. Thanks!
[4/18/24, 11:07:49 PM] ~ Shailja: I wanted to understand the whole process of H1B stamping in the home country. Has someone done it recently? How long can we stay in the home country after stamping? Is there any restrictions?
[4/18/24, 11:09:57 PM] ‪+1 (945) 213‑0782‬: Stamping is only a sticker in your passport (visa) which allows you to enter US. You are allowed to enter US until the visa expiry date. It doesn’t have any implication on how long you can stay in home country.

[4/23/24, 9:53:31 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Technically not only a proposal. It's part of the rule making process. This rule is coming. It should have been finalized at the end of March but I'm hoping it gets finalized before the end of the month.
[4/23/24, 9:54:03 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: I don't think it did. At least USCIS hasn't announced it yet
[4/23/24, 9:54:46 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: There would be an official policy manual update with these changes which hasn't happened yet
[4/23/24, 9:58:29 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I think the H1B modernization proposal  are open to public for comments 
I had a link before. Let me find it again. Or see if anyone has it. 

Apparently, It’s a regular process where they keep the proposal “like a google doc” and invite comments on it. 

The feedback period then closes and USCIS will draft new polices ‎<This message was edited>
[4/23/24, 9:59:59 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Yes, I think the feedback period closed some time ago. I put in feedback for support for self sponsored h1b along with increasing the 60 day job loss to 6 months.
[4/23/24, 10:03:38 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Awesome. 
Yeah. Must have closed in December or January this year. 

“USCIS will then accept public comments for feedback on the implications of the proposed changes. After the comment period has closed, USCIS will review the feedback and publish the final regulations. In the final regulations, an implementation timeline will also be provided.”

[4/23/24, 10:07:45 AM] Sid Sarasvati: So we don’t have the final regulation yet

[4/23/24, 10:17:25 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Solid. That’s nice to see! 
So looks like ~10-12 months from proposal to effective dates, if I’m reading correctly 

Then H1B modernization could be effective by October 2024 (that would be 12 months)
[4/23/24, 10:18:29 AM] ~ @h: Curious has anyone pitched an idea successfully at Ycombinator for seed funding? Would love to learn from the experience and process
[4/23/24, 10:21:19 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I did their startup school in 2021 
It’s a pre pitch networking curriculum to help your learn the ways around picking ideas, building, pitching, and network with fellow founders etc

- My BG; opted for a voluntary severance package from my company with final employment date of July 15
- ⁠Already started my entrepreneurial path at the start of the year with a view towards switching this year, and have one new LLC, one old holding co LLC with shares that pays out 
- ⁠Was advised that USCIS is now approving H-1B petitions for entrepreneurs in newly formed LLCs provided they
- ⁠** The structure meets employee-employer requirements per above links 
- ⁠** Have enough money in the bank for 3 years to support prevailing wage
- ⁠** Have dedicated office space 
- ⁠** Additional points to note: Can be on a part time H-1B (10-20 hours per week) in order to reduce payroll burden and cash shown upfront (in my case she said an ops manager with full time salary of $70K in NYC can be benchmark, implying ~$25K/year in the bank) / Cash shown upfront can be borrowed or gifted to show 3 year runway, and can be transferred out post application (though obviously will need to fulfill monthly payroll obligations) / Company can literally be focused on anything (i.e., doesn’t need to be a cutting edge AI firm and can be something as simple as an import/export business)
- ⁠Given above seems like they’ve already begun unofficially implementing rules - this was also highlighted as “we’re seeing recently that this route is now an option”

- ⁠Nov 2023 - Launched Vox AI - playing with voice AI (it’s also my professional expertise). App for cloning voice, music cover etc. The purpose was to hedge my bets in case one app just goes down due to GPT 5 or something. I knew I had to sponsor my H1B and I wanted a sure shot plan. 
- ⁠Hit 100K MRR in mid Jan this year. Today we are at $250K monthly revenue. 
- ⁠Yesterday - wall street journal reached out about AI and Renovation space. A milestone for us. Let’s see what’s comes of it. 

Happy to answer any question. 

But do try the Renovate app and let me know what you think (also have a webapp now) https://renovateai.app
[4/23/24, 1:39:10 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: So you were on a full time h1b before you moved it to your own company? Won't we be in conflict with h1b rules if we work and earn revenue on our startup?
[4/23/24, 1:39:44 PM] ~ Mark: Yes.
[4/23/24, 1:46:35 PM] Dad: ‎You added Dad
[4/23/24, 1:54:07 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: +1
[4/23/24, 1:54:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Depends on what you mean by “started full time” 

No I did not start full time. It was a side hustle. I invested

[4/23/24, 1:56:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The first time I started payroll was march this year- after my H1b filing

[4/23/24, 1:58:10 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “Earning revenue” on your investment is not in conflict with H1b 

I also have a cofounder who is Canadian PR
[4/23/24, 1:59:18 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: H1B founders cannot have more than 49% of equity in the company. Is that true?
[4/23/24, 2:00:07 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: I was under the impression it was more like can't actively work
[4/23/24, 2:00:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Not true 
But this requires additional work on H1b filing 
You need a board that can vote you out despite your majority ownership 
I wrote about it in my H1b article on LinkedIn
[4/23/24, 2:00:41 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s correct
[4/23/24, 2:01:15 PM] Sid Sarasvati: But you can so what investors do - like market research, raise fund, analysis, hire a CEO to run operations
[4/23/24, 2:01:34 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ hope you are trying to get an EB1a. You sir are kicking ass! I would be careful during the 485 stage. That's what scares me.
[4/23/24, 2:02:53 PM] ‪+1 (201) 208‑1353‬: Impressive!l and inspiring ... 
I have a product ready for GTM as well .. working with a law firm to get things aligned like the way you did...
[4/23/24, 2:04:34 PM] ‪+1 (720) 620‑8940‬: Is it mandatory to run payroll for the board members?
[4/23/24, 2:04:36 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Don’t be scared 
Just know the law and be complaint 

I am not giving a legal advice. But you should talk to an attorney. 

The rule is simple - you can only be a passive investor on external ventures on an active H1B. You can be a founder - this just means your have owner equity. ‎<This message was edited>
[4/23/24, 2:05:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Not at all. 
All Board members don’t even need to have equity 

Board setup is not a formal filing 
It’s a fact document that you keep for record 

A corporate lawyer will help you here for small fee. Most immigration lawyer shy away from advising here
[4/23/24, 2:07:36 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Here is my story from a different perspective: 

- I angel invested in a company 1 years ago 
- ⁠it did well. So I jumped on it full time and they helped sponsor my H1b 

Hope this helps
[4/23/24, 2:08:28 PM] Sid Sarasvati: So - find a cofounder who can help operate for you 
Doesn’t have to be a US citizen
[4/23/24, 2:10:34 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: A spouse on an H4 EAD works too?
[4/23/24, 2:11:49 PM] Sid Sarasvati: We should get at the bottom of this question. As many have asked 
I don’t have personal experience. 

Can someone ask an attorney and let us know? 
It’s be a great thing to share
[4/23/24, 2:12:06 PM] ~ Rajvi Shah: Hi group, I need lawyer recommendations for my EB1-A case. I work in tech and am a product/project manager. Any suggestions?
[4/23/24, 2:13:26 PM] ~ Deepthi Rao: I can help you with this. One of my friends is building a product for this (visa process simplified through AI). DM me!

[4/23/24, 2:19:52 PM] ~ @h: I saw we had pinned H1B O1 visa faq in the group earlier. I couldn’t see that now did we unpinned it? That post answered a lot of questions so curious…

Once passed officially I am hoping I will get free from bonded labourer like struggles.

[4/23/24, 5:50:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: REMINDER: Monthly Zoom call tomorrow 5PM EST 

I’ll start with my eb1a journey and then open discussion. Let me know if any of you have a story you wanna share - any recent approval or immigration milestone. We can have a slot for it. 

I will also share my vision on how I am thinking a non-profit organization can help this community while educating on startup immigration and business. It’s very interesting (nonprofits are H1B cap exempt)

Summary

Sid's Immigration Journey and Advice
Sid shared his personal experience with the U.S. Immigration system, detailing his initial struggles with the writing and grammar in his application for adjustment of status, and how this led to an initial denial. After improving his writing skills and reapplying, his application was successful. Sid also discussed his subsequent Eb 2 process, highlighting the challenges he faced due to the lengthy and legal language used in the process. He advised that if a visa application is denied, one should start the application process anew, and emphasized the importance of persistence and finding a favorable evaluator in the process. Mark and Sid also discussed their shared experiences with the immigration process, with Mark sharing his strategy of restarting an application after a denial.
Immigration Experiences and EB-1A Visa Guidance

Sid and Mark shared their experiences with the United States' immigration system, specifically focusing on the H-1B and EB-1 visas. Sid shared his journey of initially applying for an H-1B visa and later becoming a passive investor in his startup, while Mark shared his challenges of applying for various visas after his H-1B expired. They both emphasized the difficulties faced by Indians in the system and encouraged others to apply for green card adjustment of status. Sid shared his advice regarding the process of obtaining an EB-2 visa, emphasizing the importance of a strong professional profile and impressive publications. The team also discussed the process and criteria for applying for an EB-1A visa, with Sid providing guidance and advice based on his own experience.

Sid's Visa Journey and Non-Profit Plans
Sid shared his experiences of scaling apps and securing EB-1A and EB-1C visas, which led to his decision to consider starting a non-profit organization. He discussed the process of building a strong profile for visa applications and emphasized the potential benefits for sponsors and individuals. Sid also encouraged the team to identify their strengths and weaknesses for profile development. Shweta then presented a pricing structure based on individual needs.

EB-1A Visa Application and Process
Sid and Shweta discussed the process of applying for an EB-1A visa, highlighting the importance of working with an attorney and providing sufficient evidence. They explained the two options available: a basic evaluation with a questionnaire and a 30-minute call, and a more in-depth evaluation with a deep dive into the applicant's profile, which includes a 90-minute call. They emphasized the importance of knowing the attorney who will be handling the case, as they write the justification letter. They further discussed the challenges of finding a good doctor for the case, the importance of networking and collaboration within the Eb One community, and the goal of the process: to expedite the Eb One journey.

Sid's Transition to Education and Collaboration Plans
Sid presented his plan to transform a project into an educational non-profit organization and discussed the importance of pricing as a filter for serious case workers. He also shared his personal journey and philosophy about funding, emphasizing his company's profitability and its reliance on product sales.

Don’t get demotivated if you can’ find anything to say on some criteria. There are ways to develop it. Also, you only need to WIN 3. 
For what time I can make, I will try to meet some of you for a call to look at it together and evaluate your profile.

[4/24/24, 7:55:18 PM] ~ Johann: Hi William, I’m a Canadian citizen who has previously worked in the US on an L1B and TN visa. For a TN visa, you must have a job offer in hand because you need to show it at the border to get a TN visa stamped in your passport. For H1B, an employer must sponsor your visa and you have to be lucky enough to be selected in the annual H1B lottery.
[4/24/24, 7:57:13 PM] ~ Johann: I highly doubt Canadians can get a visa without a job offer, there are a few business visas but you need to enough capital to invest ‎<This message was edited>

[4/24/24, 9:17:59 PM] ~ Johann: Right now the US economy is not the greatest, also a number of people have been laid off in the US, so there would be many people in the applicant pool for jobs that come out
[4/24/24, 9:18:56 PM] ~ Johann: But keep trying and don’t loose hope, once the economy gets better, you will most likely get a role. I worked in the US twice on 2 different visa types
[4/24/24, 9:21:17 PM] ~ Johann: My suggestion is to contact major US recruiting companies and get those companies to do your TN visa, then you can work for the recruiting companies clients. That’s how I started in the US
[4/24/24, 9:23:39 PM] ~ Johann: Accounting and Financial auditing is an in demand profession in the US, especially if you have a CPA designation. You can easily land a role

Helped me so thought to share with fellow Entrepreneurs.
[4/26/24, 11:02:13 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Yes we are aware and eagerly waiting for the final rule to be published. Forever, you can still currently self sponsor an H1b through your own LLC by jumping through a few hoops

[4/26/24, 11:14:50 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Currently you will need the following to self sponsor an H1b under your own company: 
1) LLC registered 
2) Have significant funds in a business checking account (mainly to highlight that the LLC can pay the wages set for h1b   LCA 
3) This amount can be reduced if you have signed contracts
4) Have a Director (does not have to be paid) 
5) Run payroll and pay yourself the minimum pay as highlighted in the petition to be in compliance with your h1b ‎<This message was edited>
[4/26/24, 11:19:11 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes 
4 = need people on board who can outvote you. Since you have majority share you need to show you are still under the company 

5 = this doesn’t need to be before H1b is filed ‎<This message was edited>
[4/26/24, 11:20:30 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Number 4 will go away with the h1b rule modernization
[4/26/24, 11:21:20 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s be nice. One less paperwork.

But remember one hardest part is having a business with cash flow
[4/26/24, 11:22:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Btw — board setup and add members is done via amendment of “bylaws” document 
It’s an internal document 
You don’t file anything with IRS or govt ‎<This message was edited>
[4/26/24, 11:52:37 AM] ~ 🇮🇳 Gourav Tiwari 🇮🇳: For # 2 - how many employees you need at the minimum, is it 2 you and a director ? Also, what is the sufficient amount in numbers?
[4/26/24, 11:55:17 AM] Sid Sarasvati: 0 

$$ depends on your title and prevailing wage 
It’s a package - business plan, balance, customers, to prove you a legit business and can pay salary to the H1b person 
So maybe 70-100K in funds
[4/26/24, 11:58:02 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: If one sees document link there is provision for Concurrent filing. 
That gives transition period as running Payroll, Insurance, Letters for work can take set up time

Maybe starting part time while working in current job and eventually fully on startup.
Federal Register rule for comments was helpful providing much needed clarity for entrepreneurs. ‎<This message was edited>

For now, I have 15 mins slots (first come first serve) open and free for anyone if you want to speak with me. Add in discussion details  in there if you book a slot. I will be confirming it manually. 

For folks much deeper into business and immigration journey and I created a ‘1 hour masterclass’. It’s priced for now which is the best filter to  prioritize discussion that are serious and warrant the time investment.

[4/27/24, 1:58:05 PM] ~ Yash: Thanks Mark. Board should have at least 3 members to outvote I believe? Does LLC registration need to have the same members?
[4/27/24, 1:58:11 PM] ~ Mark: Florida is $125
[4/27/24, 2:00:45 PM] Sid Sarasvati: If you can do with Delaware or Wyoming (whiz is suitable if you wanna raise funds ever) 

Go with stripe atlas 
We paid about $300 or so 
Everything was handled online 

Incorporation in 3-4 days 
EIN in a week 
And you get the documents you need

[4/27/24, 2:37:08 PM] ~ Asif J: I didn’t get approval but spoke to both an immigration attorney and corporate lawyer who quoted a combined $9,000 in fees to get H-1B transfer set up through a new company or even modify an existing LLC which I’m a member of. If new, companies can either be a LLC (more traditional company aiming to bootstrap and scale) or C-Corp (aiming to eventually get venture backed funding)

Can share specifics on process outlined and firms if folks are interested or DM
[4/27/24, 2:38:54 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Thanks Asif for clarification. My bad misunderstood earlier.
[4/27/24, 2:39:30 PM] ~ Yash: That's cool Kartik. Did you have solo ownership for LLC or had other members included as directors with shares?
[4/27/24, 2:43:11 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Yes, have Solo for one the company.  Simple easy, less documents n headacque as time is limited. Will be adding Board members. That said company is not H1B holding company as yet.

[4/27/24, 3:01:23 PM] ~ Yash: Interesting. There's a difference between regular LLC vs H1B company? How does the transition happen?
[4/27/24, 7:25:22 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: LLC legal entity is same. To make LLC eligible for sponsoring H1 more work needs to be done like Board. Will know more once final rules published. Federal Register where draft rules published one can look at for now

I just want to see if there are more success stories here other than the creator of this group.

[4/30/24, 8:35:35 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Hello Leela, thanks for your post. Regarding - part-time H1, 

A. In my understanding, is concurrent filing only.
Only because anyone on H1B needs to work full time 40 hours. 

B. If my understanding correct that your company, you have majority stakeholder and 

C. you are filing for your H1b via your company? Or your company is wanting to file for other candidates? ‎<This message was edited>

there is another way btw - it is use a registered agent for O1 sponsorship. But details aside, O1 is not self petition like EB1A or EB2-NIW ‎<This message was edited>
[5/1/24, 9:06:22 AM] Sid Sarasvati: This is incorrect information
[5/1/24, 9:08:32 AM] Sid Sarasvati: The no lottery part is right. More precisely, O1 visa are not capped i.e no 85,000 visa per year limit like H1B. 
So most founders prefer the O1 route especially when filing from abroad as a way to come to the US. 
Unlike H1B, you also don’t need to have a degree. 
So then what do you need? 
Same 3 criteria out of 10 as with eb1a visa. But the bar is lower of O1.

[5/1/24, 9:12:19 AM] Sid Sarasvati: You can develop your profile for O1 visa. Some people prefer the O1 -> EB1-A route. 
But it doesn’t have to be that way

I went from H1B -> EB1-A

Another 2 important aspect of O1 vs H1B 
1. O1 doesn’t have wage requirements like H1B. So for founders this is preferred as they can take lower salary for the initial year and are not required by law to match the market 
2. ⁠There are different rules for dependents on O1 vs H1B. So if you have a spouse then you should consider this.

[5/1/24, 6:17:34 PM] ~ Arun kg: The information on the internet is vague on this subject. 

There is no specific bank balance requirement for sponsoring an H-1B visa. The key financial requirement is that the sponsoring employer must be able to pay the H-1B employee's salary. The employer's ability to pay is evaluated based on factors like the company's income, assets, and existing workforce costs, not the sponsor's personal bank balance.
[5/1/24, 6:19:43 PM] ~ Arun kg: I doubt anyone here can provide guidance on the money part. It seems very subjective. Best to engage immigration attorneys on this subject.

Feel free to book a call 
You should see the link in the pinned message
[5/1/24, 6:26:00 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The guidance here is to have a legit business 
Think about what USCIS doesn’t want. They don’t want scam business which are shell companies just to sponsor H1B visa 

So if you have business plan, potential clients, some funding or boostrapped, future client contracts, and $$$ in bank to ensure you can pay the salary which you will have to 
All of this goes into the package
[5/1/24, 6:27:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Mutually exclusive 

One does not compromise the other. 

Maybe I’m missing something 

Now of course, both of you should hopefully not take the CEO title :) 

I guess that will be interesting

[5/8/24, 9:26:34 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Summary from an attorney 

“To give clarity to immigrant startup founders, the USCIS has recently updated its guidance in relation to OPT & STEM OPT extensions.

It states that:
✅ You may start, own, and work for your own business during your initial period of OPT.
✅ To qualify for a STEM OPT extension, the start-up entity must meet all requirements including:
- adhering to the training plan requirements
- being a participant in good standing with E-Verify
- providing compensation to the STEM OPT student similar to that provided to similarly situated U.S. workers
- having the resources to comply with the proposed training plan.

It also states that:
💡 alternative compensation may be allowed during a STEM OPT extension if the F-1 student can show that they are a bona fide employee of the employer and that their compensation including any ownership interest (such as stock options), is commensurate with the compensation provided to other similarly situated U.S. workers. 

⭐ The guidance specifically states that you are NOT precluded from having an ownership interest in the start-up on your STEM OPT extension. 

If you are an immigrant founder on STEM OPT extension you need to make sure that: 
- you are bona fide employee of the start-up (which can easily be done because a company is a separate legal entity) + 
- you get someone else from the startup to sign the training plan attestation.”

[5/17/24, 11:53:35 AM] Girish: Hey Ravinder.

I was in that position in 2021.

My h1b was being processed from India.

This was during the Trump era ban on h1b

I had gotten a 221g and was waiting to hear back from consulate.

I was considering entering on b1/b2.

But my lawyers advised against it.
They said it could be interpreted as me trying to jump the gun
[5/17/24, 11:54:51 AM] ~ US: I have one friend who has 221g, he came to us on b1, while h1 was pending
[5/17/24, 11:55:28 AM] ~ Ravinder Singh: I see. This is actually for my brother. He is planning to travel to Canada but via a layover in US. CBP is supposed to conduct an interview for layovers as well. So technically, he wont be entering US but will take the next flight to Canada
[5/17/24, 11:59:50 AM] ~ Ravinder Singh: well anyways, thanks for the help. ✌️

[5/22/24, 1:00:11 PM] ~ Eric K.: it’s not a requirement, CPT is just a work authorization. They’ll use it for I-9 and that’s it
[5/22/24, 1:01:19 PM] ~ Eric K.: i worked for a couple of months on CPT and was paid through “economic awards”, not W2

[5/22/24, 1:06:53 PM] ~ Eric K.: CPT gets authorized, then you’re free to use it or not as you like, as long as it’s for the company who wrote your offer letter
[5/22/24, 1:11:17 PM] ~ Mark: I maintain that this is wandering into a very risky grey area...so buyer beware.

GET IT SPECIFICALLY IN WRITING FROM YOUR DSO !

[5/22/24, 1:13:16 PM] ~ Eric K.: I mean, you get an offer letter, and DSO authorizes it. In your offer letter it should say what you’ll be doing
[5/22/24, 1:13:29 PM] ~ Eric K.: now, if you are in payroll or not, that’s not DSO’s business
[5/22/24, 1:13:54 PM] ~ Eric K.: and there’s no USCIS regulation mandating to be on it during CPT
[5/22/24, 5:33:27 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: CPT is authorized by DSO. Authorization is based on Contract offer letter. And work needs to be in area related to studies.

CPT can be both 20hr and 40hrs depending on time. Like Summer 40 hours I worked. Its long ago. But rules CPT and then OPT are more or less same.

That is the very purpose of CPT to gain practical experience in outside world.
I did it myself during my Masters long ago. Prior to that during my Masters worked in DSO office and saw over 100 CPT applications from students. Time of 20 or 40 hours needs to be determined and DSO's office needs to approve prior to beginning of work. ‎<This message was edited>

[5/29/24, 6:38:42 PM] ~ Sriram: You dont have to do a a perm etc every time you change companies - currently that process takes about 2 years!   And you dont have to time your company change by guessing when PD “might” be current.
[5/29/24, 11:19:47 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Since EB2 NIW one would still have to wait for EB2 to get current? That is my understanding. I could be wrong. Yes, bypassing PERM when changing companies is a definite advantage.
[5/30/24, 12:49:43 AM] ~ Sriram: Yep you still have to wait - but the only “constraint” is having a valid H1B - not H1B + Perm + i140 etc when you become current
[5/30/24, 1:08:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I don’t think you need to restart perm on eb2
Eb2 is not current for all Indians 
One you get eb2 approved and a priority date 
You can change job and new employer can take over GC process to file i485 when dates become current 

The NIW is self petition 
You don’t need to beg your employer 

It’s eb2 with same wait times ‎<This message was edited>
[5/30/24, 1:11:38 AM] Sid Sarasvati: To answer the key question: NIW eb2 is not a shortcut to bypass gc priority dates and country quota 
Just look at the visa bulletin for final action dates 
They only mention EB2 as one big category - all dates applicable to all forms of eb2 ‎<This message was edited>
[5/30/24, 1:12:39 AM] ‪+1 (774) 253‑7536‬: Ohh ya then that's a definite advantage skipping perm every time to switch employer
[5/30/24, 1:17:36 AM] ‪+1 (774) 253‑7536‬: Another question I have an approved i140 from my employer and I moved to Canada since I got my PR , now what happens to that approved i140 ? ( I left my US employer who had sponsored it ) hypothetically say with via some miracle the PD becomes current in order to file I-485 do I still need to be employed by my employer who sponsored my i140 or I can file I-485 by myself ?
[5/30/24, 1:24:13 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: You will need to restart the process with your new employer. You will keep your original PD. Dates are not going to move based on current laws. Eb1c could be an option doing you are in Canada. If your employer in Canada has a entity in US, it could speed things along significantly. EB1a is another option.
[5/30/24, 4:19:19 AM] ~ Khushboo: Once you have i140 approved via current employer, can you get an H1b and perm transfer to your own company as long as you have the board in place?
[5/30/24, 9:10:46 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: And you have cash to pay 3 years of salary

[5/30/24, 11:30:29 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: And have regular payroll
[5/30/24, 11:31:38 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Based on prevailing wage determination
[5/30/24, 11:43:14 AM] ~ Geopher: Should this be about a minimum of $300k?
[5/30/24, 11:44:23 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Prevailing wage can be much lower. Even $65k.
[5/30/24, 11:44:53 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: One lawyer said it would even try with part time. But they haven't tried it yet
[5/30/24, 11:46:04 AM] ~ Himanshu: So minimum monthly how much need to be generate ?
[5/30/24, 11:47:43 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: From my understanding, it doesn't really matter to USCIS. As long as you pay your self the revealing wage they approved. They don't care on your revenue.
[5/30/24, 11:47:57 AM] ~ Mark: Be safe, use Salary.com for the position offered in the area of hire + 5 to 10%
[5/30/24, 11:47:58 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: And obviously having funds to pay yourself from 1.5 to 3 years in the bank
[5/30/24, 11:48:30 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Which really sucks!
[5/30/24, 11:50:16 AM] ~ Himanshu: Means ? How much in USD ?
[5/30/24, 11:51:05 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: If you get approved for $70k/yr. Then $105k to $210k
[5/30/24, 11:51:38 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Just because you might get paid $200k at your old job doesn't mean you need to pay yourself that in your startup
[5/30/24, 11:51:41 AM] ~ US: I believe even having customers signed contract may also help
[5/30/24, 11:51:43 AM] ~ Himanshu: Oh Seriously ?

[5/30/24, 11:53:06 AM] ~ Himanshu: For example- If I get that much money from somewhere in my company bank account, then how to show those entry ? As gift ?
[5/30/24, 11:53:19 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: Have spent $500+ on consultations and have heard both it both ways
[5/30/24, 11:53:50 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: I don't think it matters to USCIS. From an IRS perspective that's a different story
[5/30/24, 11:54:18 AM] ~ Raoul Hira: From an LLC perspective it's just a owner contribution
[5/30/24, 11:54:47 AM] ~ Mark: $ can be any legitimate source - bank or borrow, even family gift.
[5/30/24, 12:07:38 PM] ~ Geopher: By part time, do you mean, "concurrent H1B"?
[5/30/24, 12:09:04 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: No, as per the lawyer. If we cannot put together the funds for multiple years under the prevailing wage, you could potentially be part-time in your own company with half the paycheck for example. 
Personally I don't think it will work, the lawyer did not confirm they had success with this approach

[5/30/24, 1:57:09 PM] ~ Khushboo: Does prevailing wage depend on job title? And are there any requirements for the job title? If I just randomly Google it, prevailing wage for Bay Area seems to be an annual 170k or something!
[5/30/24, 1:58:05 PM] ~ Raoul Hira: The lawyer used SOC codes with levels within it. Can be level 1 to level 4

[6/5/24, 5:16:28 PM] ~ Khushboo: We could also create a document where we have the questions/ topics discussed in a given session and the link to the recording of the session so if new members of folks who missed the call then have the same question they can search the document and find the answers instead of asking again in the group or next call

[6/11/24, 10:31:57 AM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Yes, due to wait times being different (thats what i have heard)
[6/11/24, 10:32:18 AM] ~ Eric K.: Yeah, for indians and Chinese people the wait times are absolutely crazy

[6/11/24, 10:32:55 AM] ~ Austin: Ok noted
[6/11/24, 10:37:50 AM] ~ Ewee: Does the BRICS affiliation maybe play a certain role in that delay. Possibly the verifications and everything that may come with it. I don't know, just a thought
[6/11/24, 10:42:02 AM] ~ Eric K.: It's not about the verifications, it's about the annual cap on green cards
[6/11/24, 10:42:32 AM] ~ Eric K.: Like, the wait times for indians are super high because there are thousands and thousands of indians requesting green cards every year
[6/11/24, 10:43:46 AM] ~ Eric K.: So they are allocated in strict order of submission
[6/11/24, 10:47:25 AM] ~ Ewee: Oh I understand, it makes  sense. Thank you 🙏🏾

how long did it take for you to get this done @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩
[9/24/24, 4:12:34 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The actual application is very simple 
EIN + DUNS is all you need 

But i spend good time researching compliance obligations on and off over past month 

Some of the folks in this group helped share their thoughts. 
So thank you 🙏
[9/24/24, 4:13:46 PM] ~ Shikshit Gupta: Thanks for sharing
It would be great of you if you also share any common compliance obligations in near future here
[9/24/24, 4:15:12 PM] ~ Anu: Hey @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩. This is wonderful ! I e-verified the startup that I work for, but I am an independent contractor working 20hrs/week. Any insights surrounding compliance on that?
[9/24/24, 4:17:10 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I’ll share post tomorrow. Will cover this. 

1099 is ok. E-verify employer is imprinted for stem opt 
Usually for 1099 you don’t need to create a e-verify case as they are not employees

[9/27/24, 11:31:53 AM] ~ Leyla: Hi everyone, how long can someone stay on an H1B visa? I know that an H-1B visa holder can stay in the U.S. for a maximum of 6 years. Can it be extended beyond that especially if you don’t have a pending green card application?
[9/27/24, 11:36:53 AM] ~ Siddhartha Kantipudi: I believe that is possible only with I140 approved i guess
[9/27/24, 12:02:54 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: Anyone has any guidance on whether you can set up your own company and work for it under STEM OPT Extension? Last I heard if you have an independent board of directors this is possible
[9/27/24, 12:07:44 PM] ~ Rajprasannah K: An H-1B visa allows you to stay in the U.S. for up to 6 years. But it can be extended beyond that if:

1. You recapture time spent outside the U.S.


2. You have a pending PERM labor certification or an approved I-140 (green card process). If your green card application is pending for 365+ days, you can get 1-year extensions. If your I-140 is approved and you're waiting for your priority date, you can get 3-year extensions.



Without starting the green card process, the main option is to recapture time or leave the U.S. for 1 year and reapply.
[9/27/24, 12:12:40 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Sorry,, what does it mean to recapture time outside usa?
[9/27/24, 12:14:34 PM] ~ Rajprasannah K: "Recapturing time" means adding back the days you spent outside the U.S. during your H-1B visa period to your total allowed stay. Since the H-1B visa allows you to be in the U.S. for a maximum of 6 years, any time spent traveling or living outside the country doesn’t count towards those 6 years.
[9/27/24, 12:20:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You can reapply H1B after 6 years 
But you have to leave US for 1 years 
And redo lottery - which is crazy 

Better do eb2 or eb3 if you want to stay longer - H1B is dual intent but still a temporary employment visa

However, Please check with your attorney for validating the same.

[10/2/24, 7:39:18 PM] Sid Sarasvati: All good. This is purpose of the group 
Is your H1B approved from this entity?
[10/2/24, 7:40:06 PM] ~ Govind Nair: Yes mid last year
[10/2/24, 7:40:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I used home address 
The recommendation from attorney was to get an office in case there is site audit 
I took the risk. I assumed if an officer shows up in my building I’ll just bring him home for tea 🍵 and show my home office 
In the remote world, I assume USCIS should understand home office as a concept 

LCA is handled by attorney ‎<This message was edited>
[10/2/24, 7:46:05 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Was thinking to give address for the Registered Agent. 

But Home Address makes sense as Registered Agent address would be for receiving official correspondence. While for LLC Operations address Home address. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/2/24, 7:46:31 PM] ~ Supreet: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ - which law firm did you use for your H1B? I’ve been talking to Deel but getting mixed reviews
[10/2/24, 7:53:11 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: I had got mixed reviews too.

But then on doing Due Diligence found that Attorney I spoke though very knowledgeable and reputed, Attorney Rajiv Khanna, but he hasn't filed cases for H1 Visa holders who wish to be Entrepreneur. 

Maybe my 2 cents. Lots of reputed Doctors but if heart problem go to Cardio Doctor not generalist, that is, go to Attorney who has successfully filed for H1b Entrepreneur ‎<This message was edited>
[10/2/24, 8:16:13 PM] ~ Zoe: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ So do you mean the you are maintaining the PAF for your LCA at your home office? I was thinking of using the company's Registered Agents Address as the location for the PFA documents and then use my home office (and maybe website) for the LCA posting

Yes, this is handled by an attorney - and I'm facing similar recommendation pushback to have an office address.

2 ways - sales led or product led 

Sales is as you would know cold email with domain expertise and relationships 

Product led - you offer free to try product, figure out distribution via clever organic or paid marketing 

In either cases you need to reach your potential buyers and decision makers
[10/4/24, 8:41:00 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: I am in the process of solving this challenge.

I am traditionally a software engineer. Been in the country for a decade. Eventual goal is to own a company end to end. To do that, I figured there are 2 primary pieces
- building product
- ⁠selling product

Building is something that would be relatively easier to figure out with my technical background.

Where as selling is something I have never really thought or learned about. So I am helping sell someone else’s product.

Spent a few weeknight trying to understand how the b2b sales work.

There is the inbound piece which has things like establishing brand presence by different organic and paid ways to generate content, awareness and engagement.

And there are outbound strategies. This are the parts to it
- lead generation
- ⁠outreach strategy. The messaging, content, frequency tools etc
- ⁠doing the actual sale in a meeting.

Overall, what I understand is there are proven ways to do this. Just the way I learned how to write a backend microservice in Java, I ll learn from different resources (online sites/ personal contacts) etc and practice it.
[10/4/24, 8:45:06 PM] ~ ~: Thanks

In exchange for some equity. Afaik it should be okay since it’s technically just ownership but it’s not completely clear online. Thanks for any input here!
[10/5/24, 11:21:02 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Not sure if you can. 

Is it possible if you can take Equity in overseas account and have overseas address listed?
Or get in say parents name?

Discussion part time is ok. Maybe getting Equity which is Earned Income and you might need to examine, is what my thought process.

Many companies pay salary half in US and half overseas. Same principle. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/5/24, 12:47:25 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You can be a passive investor 

If you take couple of call for market research etc… it’s fine 
It’s a grey area as there is  nothing in the law that says what you can’t do 
So keep plausible deniability
[10/5/24, 12:48:52 PM] Sid Sarasvati: So I’m working with the attorney to schedule the October monthly call 
Will have dates in few days 


On the business decision, I would love to chat with few of you 
So please DM me if you are interested 
We will keep it low key and casual 
It’s good to have free form convo about business and learnings
[10/5/24, 6:14:43 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: Hi Guys - this is Shuchi Batra 
I’m a banker and work in the USA. I am also a poet and India’s best selling author. 
I am now thinking to start monetizing my content and sell digital courses from the USA . I have plans to get my books distributed in the USA. Can someone please guide me what needs to be done. I’m on H1b currently and it seems i can’t do monetization of my content on that. Has anyone ever created content and monetized it?
[10/5/24, 8:03:33 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Your Work Experience is impressive @⁨~Shuchi Batra⁩
[10/5/24, 9:50:45 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: Thank you
[10/5/24, 10:31:48 PM] ~ Sam: Hi @⁨~Shuchi Batra⁩
As far as I know, You should not have any issues with monetization if you do the following: 
1. Setup an LLC - single member LLC should be fine for your case 
2. ⁠Setup your LLC bank account (your monetization money goes here)
3. ⁠nominate/hire (Citizen/Greencard/EAD) as the person who manages your LLC.. he/she is the  manger in your LLC 
4. ⁠now you can say you have been working on your idea/book over weekends (this is a thin line) and the nominated/hired person manages it..
5. ⁠eventually when your earnings are high, file yourself a H1B from your LLC mentioning that your contributions are for few hours and take salary if needed or use it for EB1A strategy.. 

I am not an immigration attorney here but this is based on my learnings and understanding so far. If you don’t mind me asking, may I know what types of books did you authored so far?(you can ping me directly) ? I am interested to partner and co-author if possible. Also, let me know if you come across a different strategy, I will be interested to learn about it .
[10/5/24, 11:02:12 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: This looks like Solution to someone’s problems with our eco(system)
[10/5/24, 11:11:49 PM] ~ Sam: Yeah, This applies to most of the scenarios. Due diligence is always encouraged.
[10/5/24, 11:15:34 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Good on high level 
Just remember to stay compliant on your existing H1B. That’s not optional 

Side hustle is gray area 

For #3 - 
you don’t need anyone in US to act as operators for your LLC 

You can hire someone from family in India or wherever on contract ‎<This message was edited>
[10/5/24, 11:23:41 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Many folks have had side rental business and other real estate gigs 
This should be no different ‎<This message was edited>
[10/6/24, 12:05:09 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Maybe another view point.

Income from side hustles 
A. Passive - Stocks, Bonds, Rental
B. Active - Tech or Code or Content

If business and consequent revenue is from passive - my understanding of immigration is - no issues

Conversely, if revenue is from Active participation, could cause if someone digs in the case.

Code/ Content in US, revenue in overseas account Or self H1B in US.
Disclaimer: Not immigration Attorney. Consulting immigration Attorney can clarify points

[10/6/24, 12:27:42 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Just to be explicit - 

The qualification of passive vs active works is unrelated how you distribute money back to yourself 

Being an advisor on equity is active work of you actively work for a company - attend meetings, oversee things etc 

You can be passive even if you get money back as profit distribution 

The terminology active vs passive income is really from the tax code 
It’s used for tax deduction 
Attorneys seems to use it for immigration and H1B to make a point about this gray area where it’s not clear if an active work on side hustle could cause issues 
Nobody knows 

But yes, passive income to totally legit 
To think about it - if you invest in apple stocks and take dividends - that’s passive income 
You won’t risk your H1B for it 

Similarly, if you invest in a startup - be it yours - and take dividends, that’s not violation of H1B which allows you to be an investor
[10/6/24, 8:09:26 AM] ~ Tom Mohan: How can we use our own LLC for EB1A ? What is the strategy?
[10/6/24, 8:11:37 AM] ~ Aditya: You can show that you play a critical in role in the company that is one criteria, secondly u can show high salary which is another criteria and have higher success because u are the co founder of the company, rest all other criteria for eb-1a dosent matter even if u have your own llc
[10/6/24, 8:22:43 AM] ~ Tom Mohan: Good thanks 👍
[10/6/24, 8:25:29 AM] ~ Sam: Exactly!! Shuchi case is different.. she may or may not use the LLC for her EB1A path but it may definitely help her with monitization aspect. So it’s always better to ensure what EB1A criteria you are trying to match and proceed accordingly ‎<This message was edited>

[10/8/24, 11:51:56 AM] ~ Nav: Here is my idea that I am doing some research on since few weeks 

Idea: Implement QR codes for real-time order tracking for customers at dine in restaurants 

Usage: Efficiently collect and analyze order data; optimize operations and enhance customer engagement by offering targeted promotions to repeat customers 

Roast, critique suggest! 
If someone is in similar space let’s connect

[10/8/24, 12:18:52 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Consider articulating what problem you are trying to solve and for whom. 

For e.g is this just for dine-in? do all dine-in customers care about this problem? If you are going to a fast food chain do you care for this problem? If you are in a group do you care for this problem?
[10/8/24, 12:19:44 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Is this a customer problem or a business operations problem?

[10/8/24, 12:54:25 PM] ~ Nav: Yes these are the kinds of discussions I want to have 

Thanks for the questions 
Yes I took some time to answer them 

Is this a customer problem or a business operations problem?

This is both a customer and a business operations problem. For customers, it addresses the need for a more efficient and transparent dining experience. 
But I am not selling for customers, it’s a value addition from restaurant owners 

For businesses, it streamlines operations, reduces staff workload, and potentially increases table turnover by speeding up the ordering process.

Also, I don’t want this to be a b2b product.

I want this to be developed as a while label sass product.

 

If you are in a group, do you care about this problem?

I did think of this!

Groups might find this feature particularly useful as it allows each member to order and pay individually, reducing the complexity of splitting bills and ensuring everyone gets exactly what they want without confusion.

Also, I thought we could do some group activity feature  

 

Is this just for dine-in?

Primarily, yes. To enhance the dine-in experience by allowing customers to order and track their meals directly from their table. But that is not the problem we are solving, that just the value addition to customers … my thought is to have data to analyze, and may be to target campaign.

Fo r example when restaurants have excess of some thing that they should trash, they can bulk send messages… this is a huge value add for fast food chains

Do all dine-in customers care about this problem?

Not all dine-in customers may prioritize this feature. Some diners enjoy the traditional interaction with waitstaff… but my target is not customers… it’s a value addition from restarent owners to customers.

 

If you are going to a fast food chain, do you care for this problem?

Nope here speed and efficiency are already prioritized, so the need for QR code tracking

I have atychiphobia (fear of failure) … from immigrant perspective am more concerned about risking visa status

What is the risk form immigration stand point if my idea don’t work out 

Can we discuss about this too?

[10/8/24, 11:07:43 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: Hello all had a call with lawyer 
The easiest way is to go on H4-EAd and do whatever u want
[10/8/24, 11:07:46 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: No restrictions
[10/8/24, 11:07:57 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: It seems filing an LLC is easy
[10/8/24, 11:08:16 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: But then u must have someone ( American citizen) who can manage day to day operations
[10/8/24, 11:09:02 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: She did not give any clarity on salary guidance . I mean how much funding would need to be shown - if someone is starting an LLC and filing a concurrent H1B
[10/8/24, 11:09:15 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: Her main aim was to convince me to get on h4 EAD 😅
[10/8/24, 11:10:03 PM] ~ ~S~: You really don’t need US citizen. If you are on H4 EAD you can form an LLC and work for that LLC without any issues
[10/8/24, 11:10:20 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: But I don’t want to go on H4 EAD
[10/8/24, 11:10:26 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: I want to stay on my H1B

[10/8/24, 11:39:08 PM] ~ Rajprasannah K: I am from the bay area,  There are several  restaurants in the Bay Area using QR code ordering. Systems like Toast and Square are widely used, allowing customers to scan a QR code to view the menu, place orders, and even pay through their phones without the need for additional apps. This  is popular as it saves time and labor while improving customer satisfaction. UpMenu and Mr Yum offer additional features such as integrating with existing point-of-sale systems, sending SMS notifications for order pickups, and supporting flexible payment solutions like Stripe and Square. many platforms offer free trials, including UpMenu, but if you are interested in this area there's still room for innovation, especially in personalizing customer engagement and order data analysis.

However, I am curious to know, if you have any advice for strategic steps for achieving H1B sponsorship in addition to mass application (for example trustworthy platform/agency/group who facilites driving success)? Just to give hint, I am indicating for IT professional (Network Engineering) with close to decade long exp.
[10/15/24, 8:11:52 AM] ~ Ravi Kiran: Hi @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ 
We are currently in the process of making the MVP for our startup and are pre-revenue and did not apply for any VC funding. Do you think it would be a problem for my H1b transfer application. If yes, then in general, what would be the minimum funding or VC backing required for a safe approval? Asking because I would want minimum dilution.

[10/15/24, 9:13:03 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Funding is not a requirement for H1B. You need to show money in the bank + potential revenue stream from customers etc 

My business is fully bootstrapped. We have revenue coming from app subscriptions. 

Funding is good if that’s what you want strategically for your business. It’s somebody else’s money and they want returns on it. So think about it hard before borrowing and giving away ownership. 

If you need to raise capital, you can also look at raising a friend and family round. There are many ways to raise capital for a business both dilutive and not dilutive. 

For H1B it will come down to showing revenue generating entity, and source of revenue, + bank statement 

Either way, you need to afford your 1 year salary (a rough approximation). This should be good enough

[10/15/24, 12:00:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “income” is overloaded word; it could mean net income == profit 
you dont’ need to be profitable 
you do need revenue generation, a business plan, potential or existing customer who pay you for goods and services
you can put as much as you want in your business
[10/15/24, 12:01:23 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Think about it this way - USCIS wants to make sure one doesn’t just create a business for the sake of h1b
so as long you as you have a legit business i.e proven by what a business activities that constitutes a business in America with plan of continuity ‎<This message was edited>

1. Generate enough so that you can pay yourself your current market salary.
2. Show a strong business by virtue of revenue and a sustainable business plan. ‎<This message was edited>

[10/15/24, 8:47:09 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: But to monetize the business - we need concurrent H1b - so without showing the funds that company has to pay my salary how will I be able to monetize. For example if I want to sell a digital course - currently I’m on H1b but via my startup I can’t sell the course. 
For my startup to file an H1b - I would need money
[10/15/24, 9:25:22 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: You can move your h1b to your startup assuming you have the funds to pay your salary and a tentative plan for future revenue deals. I would recommend talking to an immigration attorney who specializes in supporting h1b founders
[10/15/24, 9:41:05 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: Step 1: Talk to an attorney

Step 1.1: start a business where you can prove that you are just helping and not actively building it. 

Step 2: build a strong revenue stream that can give you the salary that your current H1B is paying. 

Step 3: have a sustainable business plan.

[10/18/24, 10:33:24 PM] ~ Revanth Gudimalla: Yes, STEM OPT students do have the EAD and they can work on 1099
[10/18/24, 10:35:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: 1099 is ok 
But you must get your company enrolled for e-verify
[10/18/24, 10:36:57 PM] ~ Neil: Hi. Canadian here with bachelor of finance from USA. Thinking about sponsoring myself for an H1B from my US LLC. I hear that it’s sort of hit and miss any advice?
[10/18/24, 10:37:22 PM] ~ Neil: The other alternative is to spend around $200,000 hire two employees and get an E2 visa

[10/19/24, 5:23:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hi 
Welcome 
Go for it, you have nothing to lose 
It’s not hit and miss as it a lottery 
But more if you have made proper case for H1B role and proven employer employee relationship 

You will get an RFE if USCIS wants more evidence from you that way you learn what you are missing as well. Just to emphasize that’s it’s not a blind play 

You can also look at T1 visa for Canadian citizens 

What is your business?
[10/19/24, 5:23:49 PM] ~ Neil: I write a stock market investing newsletter
[10/19/24, 5:24:14 PM] ~ Neil: So I right about the market and I give a portfolio of picks that people can buy their own account
[10/19/24, 5:26:29 PM] ~ Neil: You mean the TN visa? That’s a real pain because you have to renew it every year.
[10/19/24, 5:32:47 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes TN visa 
For H1B you will have to get the lottery first if you haven’t had an H1B before 
So that’s the biggest hurdle for new H1B aspirants - more than self sponsorship 

Alternatively, looks for O1 visa options
[10/19/24, 5:32:52 PM] ~ 😀: If I’m on a H1B working for some employer, can I incorporate LLC to start some e-commerce website and setup operations, sales and marketing for that e-commerce website by my own without any employees and once it starts generating enough revenue, I can do concurrent H1B with my own company? Is this legit or what’s best way for setting up such e-commerce business ?
[10/19/24, 5:35:11 PM] ~ Neil: Actually, Canadians cannot enter the diversity visa lottery
[10/19/24, 5:36:10 PM] ~ Neil: That’s the exact same thing I was thinking. I spoke to a lawyer about it and he said that sometimes you get approved and sometimes you don’t. But I don’t for know for sure how accurate that is.
[10/19/24, 5:37:06 PM] ~ Neil: There’s always Thailand. If you put 20,000 USD in a bank in Thailand, they will give you a retirement visa and you don’t pay any taxes unless the money comes into Thailand I think you have to be 50 however
[10/19/24, 5:37:30 PM] ~ Neil: So if you make $100,000 a year and you only bring 20,000 into Thailand to live, then the other 80,000 is tax free, even if it is in a US Bank account
[10/19/24, 5:44:37 PM] ~ 😀: Should I hire someone? Will this be considered as passive investing?
[10/19/24, 5:45:26 PM] ~ Avi: Interesting idea to be in Thailand. Though I am pretty sure US will tax on all of the $100,000 if one is a US citizen/tax resident regardless which country's bank account it is in based on FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act). If one is not US citizen/tax resident then yes, it might work
[10/19/24, 5:46:01 PM] ~ Neil: Yeah, if you are American, you can forget about all that
[10/19/24, 5:48:33 PM] ~ Avi: Likely it might not be considered as a passive investing if you are working on the operations to set up the company? I think you should hire some lawyer in this space
[10/19/24, 6:14:57 PM] ~ .: That’s awesome. Does any country in the Middle East such as UAE or Qatar has anything similar to this ?

[10/20/24, 1:55:09 PM] ~ Rish: So is it considered passive income? What did your show in the tax?
[10/20/24, 2:09:22 PM] ~ Sam: Well, there is a fine line, 
1. income that is in your llc bank account - you pay different taxes 
2. income that you have drawn from your llc bank account to your your personal back account - creates a payroll taxable event - Not eligible for h1b unless you have concurrent h1

Both are different taxable events. If you don’t draw anything from your llc and continue to increase its value, file llc taxes and you are all good. 

Or, you have someone (even part time hire) manage your llc for you when you generate that 100k and file concurrent h1b when you are ready to draw the salary.
[10/20/24, 2:11:56 PM] ~ Revanth Gudimalla: Can a h1b who don’t have concurrent visa take Dividends and if yes, how to file the taxes? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:18:28 PM] ~ Sam: I don’t know about dividends, why go through the hassle and worry about tax.. h1 options are always limited
[10/20/24, 2:18:47 PM] ~ Sam: Best solution is hire your wife as manager if she has EAD and make sure she contributes and get the money back on 1099 or something ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:20:29 PM] ~ Sam: Or put you llc into a trust and manage profits/investments that way ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:22:27 PM] ~ Sam: From what I know, Taking the money out from your llc into a personal account (including payroll) will always create ~30% taxable event
[10/20/24, 2:23:22 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: What if you have no wife nor girlfriend?
[10/20/24, 2:27:20 PM] ~ Sam: llc + trust - this is the way - should save taxes..  your money stays in trust. I am not aware of a better route. And if your gains are increasing and you don’t have concurrent h1.. definitely hire someone one to manage it.. ‎<This message was edited>

More power to you and good luck 

But know that there is no fixed $$ revenue you need 
But 100k is good - really good to show as recurring revenue if you can 

Then figure out your role and salary requirement 
It will come down to that

[10/20/24, 2:35:49 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It’s income only if you take it out of your business
I had a c corp 
It’s a legal entity that files its own taxes 

I did not take money out until I filed my H1B. I started working on receipt of my application 
I have been on payroll after that getting w2 income 
Which is active income ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:38:24 PM] ~ 😀: Thanks @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ But wouldn’t IRS or USCIS question my LLC on how are you getting let’s say 90,000$ revenue without active employees on payroll or who is managing daily ops without any active employees? Just trying to figure out how it works
[10/20/24, 2:43:45 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s a good a question and a common myth 
I had this fear as well and exactly why I posted on LinkedIn and crated this group 

First and foremost - understand that IRS and USCIS and DOL are more or less independent entities 
They are not looking into your computer to catch you for fraud and deport you 

So what should you worry about? 
Compliance 

Just makes sure you are complaint with existing visa rules. So far example  - if you start taking paychecks from this business without proper H1B filing that will make you out of compliance 

Second - you don’t need “active” employee in a business. You can have offshore contractors etc etc 

I had generated 400k in revenue before even setting up payroll 

Imagine you owned a restaurant as a business. You hired bunch of contractors as staff and manager 
Restaurant generated 100k revenue for your investment 
Is that illegal as a business? 
No it’s not. 
You don’t need full time w2 employees to have a business 
Most LLC for real estate investment are 0 employees ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:46:31 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That said - I assume you could hire someone offshore - could be family in India or wherever, for some ops work ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:47:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Just pay them monthly on invoice ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:47:50 PM] ~ 😀: Dude you’re awesome! 😎 You’re the sole reason for me to get into this route and your LinkedIn is the eye opener for entrepreneurial spirits to flourish 😂And your response to above is exactly what I’m looking for or what I’m scared about basically and provided great clarity 😎

Thanks a lot 👍🏼💪🏼
[10/20/24, 2:48:38 PM] ~ 😀: So what’s the process to hire offshore contractor in India for LLC I floated in USA?
[10/20/24, 2:48:54 PM] ~ Harsha: Let's put it this way @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ If I create an LLC and establish a business as a soloprenuer ( planning to hire once it scales ) but I don't pay myself and my H1b is tied to another employer.I am assuming it is  fine
[10/20/24, 2:51:14 PM] ~ Revanth Gudimalla: Can anyone please help me in creating Board of Directors.  I mean help with documentation/agreements and process. Do I have to submit them anywhere?
[10/20/24, 2:52:54 PM] ~ 😀: Thanks again @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ for detailed explanation very very very helpful. Now I should go and figure steps/process to hire couple of offshore contractors? Also payroll/hr/labour rules/compliances would come into picture only if I need employees on W2 right? If I can give them 1099 either in USA or Offshore, do I even need to bother at all about all these payroll/hr related compliance?
[10/20/24, 2:55:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: In the order of complexity 
It’s w2 
Then 1099 
Then international 

For international contractor you don’t need 1099 
They pay their own taxes 
They have to fill a declaration form for your book keeping just to ensure they are truly not a US person 
I forget the name of the form 

Look if wanna keep it controlled just use gusto 
It’s $12 / month for US contractors 
International is free ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 2:56:52 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ is been experienced in this game
[10/20/24, 3:00:44 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Some corporate lawyer can give you a template for $50 or something 
Try googling it 

But you don’t file this anywhere 
You keep the records into your company 
Also - board changes there is a board meeting (you can pretend to have one) and keep “meeting minutes” 
After which you get signature of all the person on the new document or amendment 

Honestly, I would love to get more educated on this myself. It’s not rocket science. Just the process we need to know and follow. 

So if yon find something. Let us all know ‎<This message was edited>

[10/20/24, 5:23:08 PM] ~ Ravi Kiran: A question for step 2:
Is it really required to be done with creating the board and other record keeping stuff just after founding a company? Or can we do it just before filing h1b transfer which is like sometime after? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/20/24, 5:36:30 PM] ~ Harsha: Extension to the above question: 1.Can I create an LLC as a solo founder with employees  to manage day to day tasks and without any board  or co founder while my H1B is with another employer ? 
2 .Is board of directors or co founder really necessary if I am not paying myself ?

[10/20/24, 9:11:57 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I’ll add you for a guest post on H1BFounders.com

I’ll review it and add some context and you can be co-author 

Nice work. This is the most important thing we do as a community to help each other 
Even if we all don’t have the answers 
But together we can solve the jigsaw puzzle 🧩 ‎<This message was edited>

Add your questions here as well 

We well get this doc well refined and audited by an attorney 
This will serve long term 

As a reminder, I have blocked the coming Thursday 8PM ET (oct 24th) for a live event with Serotte law 
They are the firm who got me my H1B from my entity successfully and are well versed with H1B founder issues 

I’ll see how can I create a calendar invite with reminders outside of my official gmail ‎<This message was edited>

[10/21/24, 10:25:24 AM] ~ Hello Tej: I know this isn’t the ideal place for such a message, but I’ve been sincerely trying to land a job for the past year without success. If anyone in this amazing community is willing to refer me for a role, it would mean the world to me. Thank you so much for your help!
[10/21/24, 10:38:39 AM] ~ Keira: Cannot believe people like you find it hard to land a job.  I am also in the same boat but not with such a strong background. I hope you will land a satisfactory job very soon. Just out of curiosity, is it because of the visa sponsorship?
[10/21/24, 10:45:13 AM] ~ Nav: Hey Saiteja

I know this job market sucks and I wish to give my 2c here 

In this job market there are more qualified candidates so when we market ourselves we have to be able to do something different to stand out! 

Try the following: 

Have a portfolio (end to end) 
Have a cold reach strategy 
Optimize LinkedIn 
Have a killer resume 
   I know this hard to hear but just looking at your resume it’s not top notch 
Am not undermining your skills but the way you present your skills 

Think yourself as a product and put yourself in the shoes of a hiring manager 
Also assume you get 15-20 seconds to impress someone with 1st half of your resume 

Cherry on top 
Apply to 20-30 jobs daily 
Keep networking for the jobs applied 

I have been there and above are the strategies that worked for me so I could do it so everyone else could definitely do it 


Also one more sad part here is hiring managers are slow to intigrate AI and job seekers are adopting AI and LLmS faster and making resumes that exactly match the job description 😅 so chances of our resumes being on top of all these fake resume generated by these llm bots is tough
[10/21/24, 10:46:41 AM] ~ US: Do we have any LinkedIn experts here 🤔
[10/21/24, 10:47:50 AM] ~ Nav: Industry standard is have 1 page resume if you have < 5 yers of experience
[10/21/24, 10:48:12 AM] ~ Hello Tej: Thank you @⁨~Nav⁩
[10/21/24, 11:50:30 AM] ~ Mark: Excellent post @Nav
[10/21/24, 12:12:18 PM] ~ Rish: Great advice!! 
To add, when you reach out to the hiring manager/recruiter, keep your messaging crisp and make sure to send the exact jobs that you’re interested in. No generic message like please let me know if you are hiring for xyz roles. Please be specific on what role you are interested and send job the ID/links. 

Also another strategy that works is adding the same designation of people in the companies you are interested to work for. Sometimes after an intro message/call, they are willing to put a referral for you. A lot of companies put more emphasis on the referral so this a good way of increasing network of like minded people and also possibly getting a referral. 

Also you might not get replies from you everyone on LinkedIn so don’t be disheartened, just keep messaging. You just need one right hit and you will land a good job. Good luck!
[10/21/24, 12:17:19 PM] ~ US: Now days most of them are not open for H1bs
[10/21/24, 12:26:47 PM] ~ KL: Hi, need advice with some good consulting firms , who can sponsor for h1b the coming year for project management or construction management position, thanks 🙏🏼 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/24, 12:28:30 PM] ~ Nahid: Hey guys, a couple of questions:
1.	Can the founders also be on the board (from the perspective of showing employer-employee relationship)? For example: I am thinking of a board with my co-founder, and I, along with a third person. Would that be a valid board to show employer-employee relationship for me and my co-founder?
2.	 Can my company sponsor me for O-1 in pre-revenue stage?
[10/21/24, 12:41:16 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Yes and yes. Based on my conversation with immigration attorneys. O-1s can also be self sponsored
[10/21/24, 12:44:26 PM] ~ Nahid: Thanks, does it impact the chances of getting approved if the company is *pre-revenue*?
[10/21/24, 12:46:22 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Afaik O-1 is entirely based on your profile and whether you meet at least 3 of the 8 criteria. So it doesn't have anything to do with your company. Again I am not an immigration attorney so please work with one if you're seriously considering this route

[10/21/24, 2:18:04 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Wud be a very good option if a person is from E2 qualifying nation

Ekse get citizenship of such a nation and hold for 3 years to qualify
[10/21/24, 2:19:08 PM] ~ Giovanni Alcantara: Yes am citizen from eligible E2 country

Needs $100k+ investment. But I think for H-1B you basically need the same too per year because of prevailing wage requirement right? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/24, 2:19:42 PM] ~ Mark: E2 is great option if you have startup cash...but never get a green card so always on borrowed time to get something permanet...
[10/21/24, 2:19:55 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Right Sort of
[10/21/24, 2:20:55 PM] ~ Giovanni Alcantara: Don’t you need cash for H-1B prevailing wage requirement too? I’m a SWE startup cofounder so requirement seems to be for company to pay at least $150k in my location or how are people going around this requirement? ‎<This message was edited>
[10/21/24, 2:21:20 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Yeah u do need it
[10/21/24, 2:21:48 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: And the lottery too
[10/21/24, 2:23:03 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: E2 feels better. H1b feels like a hack where as E2 seems designed to run business.

Plus,
No lottery
Less startup amount
Amount dsnt need to go to salary
[10/21/24, 2:25:01 PM] ~ Mark: H1b lottery is a crap shoot...just cases so much pain. Can't start work till 6 months later...another croc. Unworkable rules for real life situations.

Politicians are clueless.

[10/21/24, 2:30:11 PM] ~ Mark: At least the founders H1b has a chance of sucess...so I am not knocking that....but still not easy.
[10/21/24, 2:31:05 PM] ~ Mark: They need to kill the cap...it's unworkable.

[10/21/24, 4:42:38 PM] ~ Mark: I probably had 20....but we covered everything....LLC formation, IRS registration, Business license, office photos(Huge!), Articles of Organization, Bye laws, ownership / membership details. Business cards, business PowerPoint, Business lease, Masters and MBA certs...all told a story....and paid $96,000 for a Business that prior had $90,000 in tax return.
[10/21/24, 6:04:08 PM] Sid Sarasvati: H1B is not a hack 
In the same way O1 is not hack 

Be careful of this false narrative in your head 

Most tech founder immigrate on O1 as it doesn’t require prevailing wage 
H1B is another way for many who are already on this visa with perpetual backlog on green card 

H1B / O1 -> to founder building eb1 profile - > green card 
Is IMO, most optimal path for green card for most Indian and Chinese born immigrants 

None of this is a “hack” any more than coming to another country and immigrating is a hack ‎<This message was edited>

[10/24/24, 9:24:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Did anybody had some new learning from the call that didn’t have before? Please share. Even if you got some confidence to pursue what you wanted it. Everyone will benefit from you sharing it.
[10/24/24, 9:29:39 PM] ~ Monish: That source of funding is largely irrelevant; could be VC/Angel/Bootstrapped etc. as long as there is $$ in the bank. 

Used to think a company’s finances, cash flows, profitability were critical factors.
[10/24/24, 9:31:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: yes indeed, my own businesses in 100% bootstrapped, just the money me and my co-founder put in. 
For tax & accounting  purpose - I qualified it as ‘shareholder loan’, so it’s a loan given to the company by the shareholder
[10/24/24, 9:33:50 PM] ~ Harsha: Even though you are not taking payroll from the company you founded but doing active work violates H1b rules

Solution: Hire employees who can do daily ops till you figure out your visa status
[10/24/24, 9:36:31 PM] ~ Monish: Yeah, one of the worst thing you can do is actively work, or be involved in any activity day to day that could be construed as work, without the right authorization.
[10/24/24, 9:38:01 PM] ~ Dipti Shah🫰: Sid can you elaborate more on which visa status? If the company is making money can you transfer h1b?
[10/24/24, 9:39:19 PM] Sid Sarasvati: yes, just know that “active” work is undefined. 
So Raghavan on obviously cannot advise you otherwise on record as an attorney 

But the key thing he said that you can obviously take meetings, raise funds, create vision for the businesses and actually figure things out. 

So for example - if I build an app - I could hire 2 devs in India to help with it. 
IS there a way someone could tell if I am doign active work? 
Are they gonna look at my github? repo? Not really 

Key is to avoid public title until you get authorization - CEO on linkedin etc - again it’s a gray area so you wanna take precautions just in case ‎<This message was edited>
[10/24/24, 9:40:57 PM] ~ Rithik Reddy Vedere: Can we also have usa employees in this case
[10/24/24, 9:41:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: of course - they are just expensive 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/24/24, 9:41:14 PM] ~ Monish: Sid, did you have your H1b approved for 3 years? My PD is current, wondering if a H1 transfer would be just for 1 year?

[10/27/24, 8:48:03 AM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Australia where I was a Former Resident has an E2 Treaty with the United States
[10/27/24, 8:48:04 AM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: I would check the link to see other countries
[10/27/24, 8:48:14 AM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: But I doubt Nigeria or England is an option
[10/27/24, 12:38:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Is this your first H1B? 
Otherwise H1B is 15 days with premium processing 
Most get it in less than 2 weeks of date of filing
[10/27/24, 12:43:41 PM] ~ Austin: Not all companies do premium processing
[10/27/24, 12:46:14 PM] ~ Austin: As I've come to understand, regular processing time differs depending on where potential employee is from, right?
[10/27/24, 12:47:26 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Sure 
But doesn’t change the fact that H1B approval takes 15 days with premium processing 
So one doesn’t have to wait if they don’t want to
[10/27/24, 12:57:48 PM] ~ Franz: Yeah it’s the first H1B
[10/27/24, 12:59:02 PM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: Are there any other countries that have  similar  to EB1A Visa?
[10/27/24, 1:00:41 PM] ~ Dev: UK. I think if ur on their work visa for 5 years (h1 equivalent), ur eligible for PR
[10/27/24, 1:45:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Likely dependent of processing center
But current time for non premium H1B is 5-8 months 

Note that one doesn’t need to wait for approval 
You can legally start working as soon as petition is filed and you get a receipt. Take a day or two 

But you take the risk of relying on approval. Which is risk anyway but it/ contexts dependent 

I started working for my business immediately after I got H1B receipt 
So 2 days after filing

[10/29/24, 12:41:32 PM] ~ Revanth Gudimalla: 1. Outsource to someone who can build the custom website
2. ⁠If you want to keep it simple with only few pages, Go Daddy has a website builder that you can use to build the website and for content use chatgpt. 

I can be of help, If you would like to outsource the website development
[10/29/24, 12:50:34 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: Can help with this.
[10/29/24, 12:50:35 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: If it's a simple one or two pages use web builders like Revanth mentioned. For more complex stuff go with an outsourcing partner. If you choose to go with outsourcing make sure to have your content ready and expectations in place.
[10/29/24, 12:53:48 PM] ~ Abhi: If you are going to build your own, you can Google the "No-code" website builder, look at 2-3 videos, and you should have a good understanding to start. Usually, they work like drag-and-drop functionality to build websites. ‎<This message was edited>
[10/29/24, 12:56:11 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: I would strongly recommend starting with a template that you edit as opposed to building the entire thing on your own. The templates expedite the process and help your website look professional

[10/29/24, 8:04:37 PM] ~ Mark: Smart man....if someone else gives you a quote up front - they are already fooling not just you, but themselves....
[10/29/24, 8:05:37 PM] ~ Mark: A static page on average, can take an hour, unless you have all the graphics already don e and agreed....

[10/29/24, 8:06:43 PM] ~ Mark: Don't know about you...but I am a Solutions Architect, I am not even open for discussions @ $50 an hour....
[10/29/24, 8:07:50 PM] ~ Mark: So if someone is quoting $300 for a website...you will be looking at the upsell at the end of it, with all of the things that "You didn't tell me!".
[10/29/24, 8:16:55 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: For all startups this is very important:

1. Do not go to a vendor without your homework. 
2. Your vendor is not your designer. Vendors are best at what *they* do. They operate in GiGo mode... Garbage/Gold in Garbage/Gold Out. Your job is to give them gold to work with. Don't expect them to do this for you. 
3. Create some mock ups on your own. It helps a lot. Doesn't matter if it's a sketch on a tissue paper. 
4. Create your timelines and have your milestones. 

The only thing startups must aim for in the initial stages is agility. If you aren't moving fast ... You are dead already.

[10/30/24, 10:32:34 AM] Sid Sarasvati: "When Do I Report?
FinCEN began accepting reports on January 1, 2024.
•
If your company was created or registered prior to January 1, 2024,
you will have until January 1, 2025 to report BOI.
•
If your company is created or registered in 2024, you must report
BOI within 90 calendar days after receiving actual or public notice
that your company’s creation or registration is effective, whichever is
earlier.
•
If your company is created or registered on or after January 1, 2025,
you must file BOI within 30 calendar days after receiving actual or
public notice that its creation or registration is effective.”
[10/30/24, 10:42:23 AM] Sid Sarasvati: you have to report Beneficial Owner - which is 
“Each individual with 25% or more equity interest in the legal entity, whether directly or indirectly”
[10/30/24, 10:43:24 AM] Sid Sarasvati: It takes 10 mins to file by yourself.

[10/30/24, 11:28:02 AM] Sid Sarasvati: why would you not?
[10/30/24, 11:38:36 AM] ~ ~S~: It is mandatory. If you don’t do they will assess penalties

[10/30/24, 5:06:44 PM] ~ Niv: Hello All needed some suggestions or guidance do y’all think that it is wiser for us to involve corporate lawyer right from the start or we use Google and other sources to set up the company and once we are up and running, we hire a corporate lawyer to take the affairs ahead ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/24, 5:07:01 PM] ~ Niv: The ones that I have been talking, they are really pricey charging close to $600 per hour which is something which I cannot afford right now. Is there any suggestion for a corporate lawyer who is affordable?
[10/30/24, 5:07:51 PM] ~ Asis Kumar Mandal: In my opinion it should depend upon complexity of your situation
[10/30/24, 5:08:25 PM] ~ Asis Kumar Mandal: If you are solopreanure and slowly discovering market . U can upgrade things later..

[10/30/24, 5:14:12 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: You could get any corporate lawyer around especially online
[10/30/24, 5:14:38 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: I met someone yesterday let me confirm if I could share their contacts with the group
[10/30/24, 5:14:57 PM] ~ Rithik Reddy Vedere: it is advisable to consult a lawyer before doing things. As it helps you comply with the state/fedral laws. They could also help you decide your business structure?

You could also do things later but would cost you more later
[10/30/24, 5:56:26 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Are you looking for assistance registering a company? if so, you can try talking to Priya @ ledgerline.xyz and you can also talk to @⁨~NISHIL SHAH⁩ who is a CA and has experience setting up companies in the US /India and is also in this whatsapp group

I recently registered my company using Stripe Atlas as a sole founder. If you have multiple founders and some of them are in India or other regions with their own local regulations, then that adds complexity
[10/30/24, 9:59:47 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It depends 

Especially now that online services are startup friendly and cost effective
[10/30/24, 10:00:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: What is your exact situation?
[10/30/24, 10:14:37 PM] ~ Niv: I am just wondering if legal zoom and google is ok for Initial set up. I want to make sure I do not miss out any forms deadline etc
[10/30/24, 10:37:54 PM] ~ Nitin: I am in VA and I registered single member LLC myself after talking to my CPA who was asking $600. He said you can start with single member llc and then we can change things later as needed. I will pay him later when the time comes to change things up but for now I got my EIN from IRS, registered LLC with Virginia and with tax department. It seems to me a straight forward process but I will talk to my CPA again with what I did and will pay him to make things right if in case I did anything wrong.
[10/30/24, 10:42:49 PM] ~ Himanshu: If you are on H1, then you can’t open LLC. You can open only C-Corporation.
[10/30/24, 10:43:35 PM] ~ Nitin: I didn’t , my wife did who is on H4 ead
[10/30/24, 10:47:26 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You mean initial setup of the business entity? 

Step 1 - decide what kind of entity you want 
LLC vs C-corp 
Or S-corp if all owners are US person - green card or citizen  

I have my own preferences. But it depends on you, business and tax strategy 

Nobody can teach you this as a hired CPA on a call 
They will tell you what they know. 
I read 4 books to grok the basics so I can talk properly with CPAs I hire 

When in doubt - go with LLC filed with your state. It’s the least complicated and gives you liability protection 

Step 2 - create the LLC or c-corp and get EIN number
You don’t need a lawyer for this 

Hire a CPA for $200-300 to get the job done. Or do it yourself online. 

Step 3 - you will have to file tax by April 2025 
Again you don’t need an attorney for this 
But the CPA. If you are just starting up this will be less than $150 ‎<This message was edited>
[10/30/24, 10:55:12 PM] ~ Phani: No. Anyone can open an LLC
[10/30/24, 10:55:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: TL;DR - get a good CPA to stay complaint, if you feel uncomfortable 
Corporate attorney comes later. And only if you have something out of the ordinary. 
Creating a board or adding members is the easiest template one can find online.  
I paid $50 to my cooperate attitude to give me one because I was wanted the assurance
[10/30/24, 10:56:35 PM] ~ Phani: SID- just fyi… US Person means who resides inside USA legally. H1B residing in USA is also an US person. Doesn’t need to be GC/Citizen.
[10/30/24, 11:26:23 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hm, then US person is incorrect usage for Scorp by me 
Scorp strictly requires all shareholders to be green card or citizen 
I think there is a singular term for this group…
[10/30/24, 11:27:02 PM] Sid Sarasvati: FYI - https://x.com/vikas_sabbi/status/1851765274204344407?s=61

Hey Sid,

I finally gathered all the courage from this group and decided to register my business entity!
I have a few final questions:

1) Which is better for registration, Incfile or Doola?

>>Should I be concerned about giving my SSN, or would Doola be preferable since it allows setup without an SSN? (I’m currently on F1 OPT, and my partner has an H1B)
>>For a business account, should I go with mainstream banks like Bank of America or Chase, or is Mercury better since it doesn’t require an SSN?
>>The reason I want to avoid using my SSN is to minimise scrutiny or further questions from the IRS or USCIS.

2) How can I determine what additional licenses I’ll need to operate my business?
3) How do I stay compliant with federal and state laws during operation? Are there any services to help monitor compliance?
4) How is company address and Registered Agent address different; Incfile requires me to pay 29/month for virtual address
(I currently don’t plan to have a physical office, plan to run virtually) What do yo suggest?

Thanks so much for your guidance!

[11/6/24, 1:18:48 PM] ~ ~S~: We should not worry too much about this. There is going to be noise everywhere and who knows which president will make what decision. We should focus on what we want to do and also work on keeping some alternatives in your back pocket. If you get impacted you move with the alternative plan.

Would you be able to create an article on how to register an LLC with a cofounder from another country. Where should we consult affordable and good lawyers for partnership agreement or any other such legal requirements. 
And where can we get good and affordable CPA who will do tax filing for both partners. I think many of us are not very confident in these legal aspects. So general guidelines in detail and recommendations for personalized help will be useful for many.
[11/7/24, 3:01:44 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I’m planning a call for all us for open discussion 
We can focus on these aspects of business formation

[11/9/24, 2:03:42 PM] ~ Abhi: Hi guys, 
I have some questions around finance side.
1) What software are you using to pay employees/yourself. I understand you can setup any bank account and show a transfer into your personal account. However, the two areas that i am looking are: W-2 generation, and filing tax. Though from what i know, tax filing can be done via other ways too.
2) If any of you have idea about setting up ESOPs towards employee benefits.
[11/9/24, 2:08:18 PM] ~ M: Quick books
[11/9/24, 2:27:49 PM] ~ Abhi: Does it do both?
[11/9/24, 3:45:57 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Use gusto for payroll 
Not expensive and easy to get started
[11/9/24, 4:16:40 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Also W2 is complex as each state has their own compliance 
Do 1099 as much as you can 

For my business I’m the only one on W2
[11/9/24, 4:18:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hiring offshore is the easiest 
No different than paying a vendor
[11/9/24, 4:30:18 PM] ~ ✌🏻: I have a question about freelancing...
Is it legal for a person (in H1B) to accept payments for freelance work in upwork via a LLC
[11/9/24, 4:35:04 PM] ~ Sam: Anyone hired engineers from outside of US for project work? how did you maintained payroll for them and  reported as expense during tax filing? Is there a better way to do this other than Xoom ?
[11/9/24, 4:40:26 PM] ~ Vaibhav Shrivastav: I’d also like to know if anyone has experience in hiring outside US and the pay structure? Do you need to open a branch of your US company in other country and open a foreign bank account for that company to pay employees?
Or just hire them showing that they are vendors/freelancers and pay them?
[11/9/24, 5:01:36 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Make sure you keep the receipts 
So get invoice for your expenses 
That’s what that matters for taxes 

As for payment - so what works and is simple and consistent 
Use business bank account and card 
Should go without saying - don’t mix personal with business
[11/9/24, 5:02:34 PM] Sid Sarasvati: No 
Just pay invoice like you pay for anything 

I have used a mix of PayPal, pioneer and direct bank transfer via international Wire 

Be sure to get invoices 🧾
[11/9/24, 5:05:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You definitely don’t need to establish anything for hiring offshore 

You need that only if you wanted to give them company benefits and hire full time with career etc 

Even for that there are now third party solutions call - EOR 
Example - Deel 
They hire full time for you on some countries and provide benefits 
You pay Deel like a vendor 

You can avoid all that just pay directly
[11/9/24, 5:07:32 PM] ~ Sam: Thanks for invoice idea. Yes, diligently following with the bank idea. Personal bank account and business account are separated already. 
1. Do we need to ask the candidate to send us the Invoice ? 
2. ⁠How do we deal with experience letters or local payslips when they leave ? Often, people want to join us for experience 😬
3. ⁠Do we need to take the contractor route ? ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/24, 5:11:40 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Just number your questions next time 
Easy for me answer :) 

1/ yes - you can ask for monthly invoice if you are paying hourly - so for example $2000 for x hours of service 
The invoice will have the entity that you are paying + bank account info 

Paying taxes is their responsibility and not yours 
For you - you must document the expense for accounting 

2/ not sure what you mean, but sounds like it depends on how you manage your business 
You can give reference and expertise letter. That’s your decision - independent of Tax or USCIS 

I usually give contract (generated from chatgpt) to every contractor with rate and service description 
And protect my IP 
I put termination clause there as well
[11/9/24, 5:11:52 PM] ~ Vaibhav Shrivastav: Is this the site you are referring to : https://www.globalization-partners.com/global-human-resources-lp/?utm_keyword=hr%20outsourcing&utm_device=m&utm_source=Adwords&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=usa__search__global_human_resources__%5Ben%5D&utm_content=global_human_resources&utm_term=hr%20outsourcing&hsa_acc=2637010124&hsa_cam=1051314696&hsa_grp=51183627826&hsa_ad=673998783241&hsa_src=g&hsa_tgt=kwd-10753961&hsa_kw=hr%20outsourcing&hsa_mt=b&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAACdtKqu3sYdiSai7kvdJc6EPZVPBc&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjITKwa5SaRN--nwUhbRL90ZD788MuK-MgF5WdBvDpd3cOTS8ybqWi5saApLYEALw_wcB
[11/9/24, 5:12:26 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Just search for EOR 
Employee of record 
There are many vendors
[11/9/24, 5:14:59 PM] ~ Satya: US big companies used to completely rely on Indian out sourcing tech companies like tcs, infosys, tech mahindra etc but from the past decade things have changed , many US businesses (companies ) like Anthem, UHG, TJX etc have their own IT development entities in India , they called them as GICs (global innovation center), as per my knowledge these GICs are registered companies (LLCs) in India
US entity pay Indian entity per hr basis for each EE (tech Employee) who are billable , India entity has to run on its own from the income generated by the billable resources
US entity just have to pay for the no of total  work hours billed by billable resources , there are many other US companies have their own GICs back in India
[11/9/24, 5:16:34 PM] ~ Satya: Admin, HR etc fall under non billable workers
[11/9/24, 5:17:23 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes that’s fine 
But that’s not required to hire in India 

I opened a dev center in Hyderabad during my time at Compass - real estate 
This saved the business taxes as their was incentives from govt 

But all of that is not something that should matter to small business and founders 
These are very high cost long term startegies 

Hiring should be fast. Because you also wanna fire fast - in case ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/24, 5:17:30 PM] ~ Satya: Just sharing my knowledge as I had worked for few of those companies woking in this model while I am in India
[11/9/24, 5:18:28 PM] ~ Satya: Yes Sid , these are big enterprises
[11/9/24, 5:18:36 PM] ~ Sam: Sorry, Numbered and updated.
2. People who we want to hire always look for experience letters. How do we deal with this type of scenarios if we don’t have a base in India ? The reason being, hiring a full time employee will turn out to be cheaper in long term. 
3. ⁠I like the contract idea with termination clause
[11/9/24, 5:20:22 PM] ~ Satya: Now a days , many US tech companies hiring Indian remote workers and paying them in $$$
[11/9/24, 5:20:45 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I can share the contract template I use once I’m on computer 
You can tweak it 
I have kept it 1 page and super tight making sure it covers and protects us
[11/9/24, 5:25:22 PM] ~ Satya: We see this trend in US tech start ups, kind of win win for both parties, let’s say for a skill full full stack developer in US pay range is like min 150k$ and above , these companies paying 40-70k for Indian remote devs , it’s half the the cost for them and 40-70k $ in India is very lucrative pay based on the experience of devs
[11/9/24, 5:25:24 PM] ~ Sam: For a startup.. We cannot pay in $$$ anytime soon (or at least until we generate reasonable revenue or investments) hard facts 😬 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/24, 5:30:59 PM] ~ Satya: not exactly bootstrapped ones, the ones have enough funding already or mid size companies I mean
[11/9/24, 5:31:01 PM] ~ Sam: These startups might have at least gone through some seeding cycles and generating revenue. Personally I am not aware aware of any initial startup spending that much without going live.. paying $50k to $70k per person in India is a dream for now 😅😅..
[11/9/24, 5:31:41 PM] ~ Satya: US remote jobs are paying
[11/9/24, 5:35:45 PM] ~ Sam: Ha ha, I am not denying that. I am just saying for startups or people that are in this group who are entry level founders, this may not be something we can do right now. I know it’s going to happen in future when we generate enough revenue.. but at this point, as a budding founder, I am not willing to pay/invest that kind of money on one developer  🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[11/9/24, 5:45:07 PM] ~ Satya: true and agreed
[11/9/24, 5:54:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Founders path is a path of utter responsibility 
You own your failures 
And must you learn to own your success as well, when time comes
[11/9/24, 5:58:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Adding VC to this mix turns this game a bit nasty. 
Good for some, really bad idea for others 

 VCs want 10-50x growth. They coerce you to hire fast. You squander money. Business problem turns into organization problems. Anxiety fills most of your days. And you have no way to exit as you are bounded by big $$$$$ riding on your back
You sit and then wonder - maybe I was better making $$ as an employee with so much less to worry about 

Growth for the sake of growth is cancer. 

I’ll leave it to that
[11/9/24, 6:00:54 PM] ~ Sam: Well put together 👌
[11/10/24, 6:08:03 PM] ~ Vaibhav Shrivastav: A quick question for the group:
1) Do we need/can you suggest some business attorneys that helped you design the cap table, equity cliff, paper work etc. for your business entity and help with laws to setup business outside the US? Also, if you can suggest some resources to help understand these laws, equity structure etc for 1st time founders; I know “Y combinator” is a one of the good source. 

Apologies if this question was asked/answered before.

I noticed USCIS says it checks all h1b petition against its VIBE system. Did anyone of you have to set up DUNS # for your startup for this? Or how did you address the VIBE validation?
[11/11/24, 3:16:58 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes I had do 
I had to way before my H1B as Apple needs DUNS number to register your company on AppStore and generate sales 

Takes $50-100 i forget, but do it already as it could take up to 3 weeks 

Once you have a DUNS number it means your company can be validated

[11/13/24, 12:05:09 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Anyone seriously interested in bitcoin, I highly recommend to watch this talk - https://youtu.be/YjxhWV_Ha4g?si=SfextSGq2bt1QAeC

I don’t recommend playing the “crypto” game of buying and selling. But if you are smart enough for it, suit yourself. 

For others - bitcoin is store of value. It’s where you can store money - economic energy - without leak (inflation) 

You can do this by buying real estate, gold or bitcoin ‎<This message was edited>

Hey Sid, any info regarding this?
[11/13/24, 12:48:39 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I received my PR earlier this year, so this is something I am going to look into. 
I don’t know much beyond small business testimonials that SBA loans are good

We can discuss this at our call later tonight if anyone wants to share anything.
[11/13/24, 12:50:30 PM] ~ Rithik Reddy Vedere: Sure😅
Would need assistance on how to get funding or loans for non citizens, especially oh H1b or F1
[11/13/24, 12:58:44 PM] ~ Rithik Reddy Vedere: Is there a possibility of getting a loan if we get a cosigner??
[11/13/24, 1:11:13 PM] ~ Ashish Verma: I’m trying to understand this as well - from the government website, it looks like there is specific criteria to be met for non US citizens to get SBA. (51% US citizen ownership, collateral needed, etc.)

But Also- many foreigners regularly secure financing for E2 visa to buy or start businesses (even though they don’t have any US credit history to get debt)

there should be a way for us too.

The main criteria is credit score (I briefly spoke to one lender but he didn’t know about restrictions being on visa). I need to find about the Non US citizen specifics.

I’m talking with some lenders soon on this. ‎<This message was edited>

I am trying to file for CPT with my company and I don’t know if that’s possible to achieve.

I have a registered company and I want to submit the letter to my school as I am doing an internship there.

However, the school will require my employer’s EIN to verify and I don’t know if that will show I am still the company owner. 

Can I have any help regarding this?

Thanks.

[11/14/24, 12:31:03 PM] ~ Govind Nair: Quick data point for others to consider. 
About a year back started a new studio with 6 other colleagues from my last company. I am the only H1B based founder.
My H1B transfer was approved within 2 weeks and received my i-797 within 3 weeks.
One of the 7 was the primary founder and this would be their 2nd or 3rd company they started. So they had the knowledge and support system to get something off the ground quicl.
The company was setup as a partnership LLC. We have had between 5-10 employees at various points until now. 
The 7 founders (including me) were taking distributions (K-1) and were not on direct payroll. This was flagged as a potential red flag in this group since an employer-employee needs to be maintained between the entity and the H1B applicant.
We pushed our lawyers more on this topic. So apparently a W2 is definitely the easiest way to showcase the relationship. However, it can be proven this is case since the primary founder does have the right to "fire" any other founder. Their advice is to me put on payroll if possible.
That said, I did receive my updated Visa stamp last week so it has worked out so far. There is definitely a financial benefit of receiving direct K1 distributions vs going through payroll; so I might delay being put on payroll until the last year of my current visa validity. 
Sorry for the long post; but have been lurking a bit and wanted to provide some value as well.

[11/14/24, 12:40:42 PM] ~ Govind Nair: Honestly I think its on the grounds of the one of the founders having built a company that ran for 15+ years (I was part of it) and the fact we had two projects already lined up. Essentially the last company we were all part of shut down and we started a new one.
[11/14/24, 12:41:57 PM] ~ Shashikanth Akula: Awesome

[11/22/24, 5:01:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Accounting is subjective and broad 

Tax filing could be as low as $200 
I have done it through Upwork 

Bookkeeping is another cost - that can be monthly or quarterly or whatever works for you 
I do bookkeeping myself .. so far 

Then tax strategy and consulting is another matter. This is where it gets expensive with $350 or higher hourly rate 


Not all CPA are equal. But for basic tax filing I wouldn’t worry too much. Just get the job done
[11/22/24, 6:45:50 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Thanks for the reply. Actually, in WA I have to file monthly excise return. Any input on that?

I’m looking for a base equity (very small) + incentive based ideally.. where they get something based on the deals they help bring

Any help will be appreciated!!
[11/23/24, 10:05:45 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: 1-2% equity (if early stage) or <1% (if the revenue and growth are promising). + Decide monthly incentives based on no of hours.

Try to look for rates for professional services in that sector
[11/23/24, 10:10:09 PM] ~ Mansi: Also consider the possible impact of future equity dilution.
[11/23/24, 10:13:17 PM] ~ Supreet: Thanks! Any benchmarks on outcome based incentives? Eg - if you help bring $1M, you get x%
[11/23/24, 11:03:47 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: Can you give more information on tasks?
[11/24/24, 12:09:35 AM] ~ Supreet: Tasks include - intro to new prospects, significant involvement in structuring and closing the deal and incentive related to deal size.. that was the plan.. is that normal? Anything else to consider? Also how to make terms very explicit?
[11/24/24, 12:22:32 AM] ~ neel: Hey Supreet, I am curious what your business / startup is. Mostly advisors in niche or extremely complex area of business operations are compensated with non diluted equity which is generally between 0.50 to 1 % but this also depends on, how quickly the business my fly or what is the TAM or what is the impact etc. 

You should also offer some hurdles. For example: 

Hey Advisor, you would get 1 % but those are divided by following. 

1. You help us raise X dollars 
2. ⁠You provide advisory of 50 hrs a year 
3. ⁠or a milestone that is more relevant for your business. Ensuring its not sweet equity.
[11/24/24, 12:24:49 AM] ~ neel: This is normal, but hard to put up in a soft mutual contract. 

The other way you can be like, hey : we won’t formally get this, but if we meet certain milestone, we would offer you with vesting a part of that 1 % 

Say 1 % share are 100,000 then you would vest say 20,000 shares at $1m / arr fund raise. 

Now, the Advisor will only help your advice or strategise the deal. 

Like for my case, I help them with all of my learnings, and experiences from my past. But I dnt get directly invovled in the fund raise or pitch. 

But yeah, this pretty normal.

[11/26/24, 12:27:22 AM] ~ Neil: But getting the E2 to begin with is kind of a pain because I don’t have $200,000 at the moment

[11/26/24, 8:51:10 AM] ~ Johann: Or are you a naturalized citizen? Because the GC process is different for the two scenarios
[11/26/24, 8:52:44 AM] ~ Johann: You also have the option of a TN visa and could apply for a GC on a TN visa too but it’s a little more tricky and also depends on your country of birth
[11/26/24, 8:53:55 AM] ~ Johann: You can only apply for an H1B next year
[11/26/24, 8:54:19 AM] ~ Mark: You can get the E2 for less....100k is more than sufficient.
[11/26/24, 8:55:34 AM] ~ Mark: You say H1b easy...but it literally never is...remember it is a lottery at best case where 300,000 people apply and 65,000 get..
That alone makes it a shit show....
[11/26/24, 8:55:59 AM] ~ Mark: Then you get approval in April for an October start....also shitty....
[11/26/24, 8:57:37 AM] ~ Mark: Technically you can start the GC even in the first year of H1b, but good luck with that because these days that's a $10,000 expense that few companies will swallow for a generally available skills job....not a specialist...
[11/26/24, 8:58:32 AM] ~ Mark: The GC process will take two years.
[11/26/24, 8:58:51 AM] ~ Mark: At best.
[11/26/24, 8:59:13 AM] ~ Mark: Without the Trumpanze getting involved.
[11/26/24, 9:00:36 AM] ~ Mark: Sorry to be a Debbie Downer.🤣
[11/26/24, 9:02:05 AM] ~ Johann: GC process takes about 2 years if you were born in Canada. For each country of birth the wait is longer. For India and China born the wait is ridiculous on EB2 and EB3 and Mexico too if I’m not mistaken.
[11/26/24, 9:03:14 AM] ~ Mark: Correct.
[11/26/24, 9:03:53 AM] ~ Jula Sherene Mervin: Only India has much wait time like 10-15 years China & Mexico is still good & has only 2 or 3 years wait time I guess

[11/26/24, 9:09:54 AM] ~ Mark: Yeah....I like that process....it is a fairly predictable route....
[11/26/24, 9:10:49 AM] ~ Mark: DM me I am very willing to give you some very important details....
[11/26/24, 9:11:02 AM] ~ Mark: If you decide to go E2
[11/26/24, 9:11:08 AM] ~ Johann: Right, and the good thing is that even your dependents can work
[11/26/24, 9:11:36 AM] ~ Johann: Sure, will do, thanks so much 🙏🏽

[11/26/24, 9:12:52 AM] ~ Bala: Quick question: people can study as well on E2 visa
[11/26/24, 9:15:02 AM] ~ Mark: Your kids and wife can easily...there are some nuances to the primary studying...
[11/26/24, 9:15:33 AM] ~ Johann: Yes you can study but you need to run your E2 business as well so it will be hard
[11/26/24, 9:15:43 AM] ~ Mark: Correct.
[11/26/24, 9:16:07 AM] ~ Mark: So it has to be incidental study...not primary intention.
[11/26/24, 9:16:41 AM] ~ Johann: That’s right
[11/26/24, 9:17:08 AM] ~ Vikram Shete: That's not mentoring. Thats business development. If that's the case then the incentive typically will hover around 10-15% and reduce as deals get larger. Totally depends on industry and quality of lead.
[11/26/24, 9:17:37 AM] ~ Johann: I was in the US on an L1 visa from 2010 to 2016 and studied part time
[11/26/24, 9:19:15 AM] ~ Vikram Shete: Mentoring is different ballgame. 

As a mentor, I do not charge by the outcome. 
It's retainer or retainer plus equity.

Mentor/Advisor equity should not exceed 3% at any cost. ‎<This message was edited>

[11/26/24, 11:37:32 AM] ~ Prakash Verma: openbank.us this is online bank from Santander and they have 5% APY with no fee
[11/26/24, 11:50:14 AM] ~ Yashasvi Tumuluri: Hello everyone, I need some clarification regarding my new employment opportunity.

I am currently on STEM-OPT EAD and recently interviewed with a startup. The employer is willing to extend an offer; however, there’s a unique condition:

Since the company is in its growth phase, they are unable to provide regular monthly paychecks. Instead, they are proposing “equity” as the sole form of compensation. (I.e equity = compensation)

I would like to know the best ways to handle this situation while maintaining my STEM-OPT EAD status legally and without complications. Are there any recommendations or alternative approaches that would allow me to work with this arrangement and stay compliant with the STEM-OPT requirements?

*This is the message stated by the company: 
This role is equity only, with a transition to cash compensation once our fundraise is complete. *

Looking forward to your insights!
Thank you.
[11/26/24, 11:58:52 AM] ~ Maninder Singh: 😂. I mean not that much.
[11/26/24, 11:59:46 AM] ~ Maninder Singh: Thanks, Prakash.
[11/26/24, 12:30:24 PM] ~ .: Having saving in this day and age definitely should be a Swiss affair 😂
[11/26/24, 4:36:53 PM] ~ Avi: I typically use Wealthfront as my primary checking account as it provides 4.25% APY for zero fee *Checking* account (so there is no limit on number of monthly transactions [for savings it is limited to 6 withdrawals per month typically], ACH billpays are free for credit card/utilities payments, and parked cash there always keeps earning APY). It used to be 5% APY till recently before Feds lowered the rates, which was the best option I could find to earn high APY on a checking account. Have a referral link that gives you 4.75% APY if you or anyone is interested
[11/26/24, 4:38:28 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Thanks Avi, that information is really helpful
[11/26/24, 4:39:46 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Do they issue cheques?
[11/26/24, 4:42:36 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Looks like it is for personal use only, not business.
[11/26/24, 4:43:01 PM] ~ Avi: They kinda do, but you have to write checks using their online portal as opposed to they issuing checkbook (perhaps it is better as I don't need to recall where my checkbook is as I don't write checks often, perhaps I write once in a decade lol ). It is free though https://support.wealthfront.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048011352-Send-a-check
[11/26/24, 4:43:48 PM] ~ Avi: Yes, correct - for business it is hard to get that kinda APY+free features if you are looking for business checking/savings accounts
[11/26/24, 4:44:13 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Yes, I am looking for business.
[11/26/24, 4:45:01 PM] ~ Manish: Pretty much anyone I know who has a registered LLC for any purpose uses Wells Fargo.

[11/26/24, 4:52:53 PM] ~ Avi: I guess there are many large banks (for Business 'US Bank' also has some good promos going on periodically, or Chase) that you can use for business accounts. However, in my experience you won't get much APY
[11/26/24, 4:53:05 PM] ~ Avi: Also for anyone who is thinking about Wells Fargo, they don't really have a good ethical reputation after their scams (https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wells-fargo-agrees-pay-3-billion-resolve-criminal-and-civil-investigations-sales-practices and https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-orders-wells-fargo-to-pay-37-billion-for-widespread-mismanagement-of-auto-loans-mortgages-and-deposit-accounts/ of several others) and I wouldn't use them. Use your caution
[11/26/24, 4:53:14 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: I use Bank of America for Personal Checking at the moment
[11/26/24, 5:59:08 PM] ~ Jula Sherene Mervin: You cannot solely be on equity
[11/26/24, 6:03:45 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: DSO is the right person to say this, person can be only only) o equity if everyone’s getting same compensation (my views)
[11/26/24, 6:07:37 PM] ~ Jula Sherene Mervin: It’s quite simple, STEM-OPT must’ve regular paycheque while equity can be part of it but not solely dependent upon! There is something called minimum wages according to labour laws.
[11/26/24, 6:09:10 PM] ~ 16128100524: Can someone tell me how much Lawyers are charging for h1 transfer?  Someone said $6k plus h1 fees seems too high
[11/26/24, 6:11:00 PM] ~ Manish: By STEM OPT you mean the first 12 months or you mean the 24-month STEM OPT Extension? I heard the rules for first 12 months are more relaxe
[11/26/24, 6:11:22 PM] ~ Manish: eventually DSO can give the authoritative answer
[11/26/24, 6:11:32 PM] ~ Yashasvi Tumuluri: The 24 months
[11/26/24, 6:12:30 PM] ~ Yashasvi Tumuluri: Yes the DSO said equity can be a part of the compensation 

As it’s mentioned by the DSO that

[11/26/24, 7:20:36 PM] ~ Niv: I guess yes you can but there are lot of requirements,
[11/26/24, 7:20:51 PM] ~ Niv: You can consult a lawyer who can help you with it
[11/26/24, 7:21:46 PM] ~ Niv: there are some exceptions to this rule. The current immigration laws allow foreign entrepreneurs to self-sponsor their H-1B visa if they meet certain requirements4. They must establish that the company has the right to control them4. They can also be the CEO or a board member of the company sponsoring their visa2.

Just a normal course or state of H1B for those stuck on green card backlog 

When you hear stories of folks stuck on H1B for 15 or so years, this is what they mean. 

H1B can continue to renew or transferred to new companies for over 100 years or how much ever the time one is waiting in queue 

This is a life I lived for 15 years. Not fun. 
You are always a temporary worker. At the mercy of employer to keep your stay in US 

On top, you have confusing laws of what you can or can’t do as side hustle 

You need H1B to work on anything officially. Your founder / entrepreneur dreams are crushed (or so you think) 

Thus this group. ‎<This message was edited>

Since I work in finance and have connections in the industry, I could get someone to sponsor me pretty quickly. I think it took about a month for me before I was thinking about doing that for a couple of years and then saving up some money to do an E2 and work at my own company where I hire two employees maybe. But a green card might be better because I don’t think I really need any employees for what I do Canada is the best country for moving to the US obviously. There is an old unwritten law that has something to do with “same land“ which is why the aboriginals in Canada and the US can work in both countries without any permits at all they just need to do some paperwork
[12/1/24, 2:15:45 AM] ~ Neil: So when I Canadian goes into the US and vice versa, they are not actually looking for a reason to let you in… They’re looking for a reason to NOT let you in. It’s an old Latin phrase for same land. Probably the same thing has to do with Europeans in Europe. For example, it’s pretty hard to stop a German guy who wants to drive into the Netherlands and vice versa.

I am looking for some guidance 
I’m going to India for my H1B stamping drop box appointment on 12th December . I am planning to come back by 28th December . 
Is it safe to go to India for stamping now or shall I wait and do it next year. As I’m reading a lot of news about risk of entry 🥹
[12/3/24, 6:43:59 PM] ~ Ennamo Po: I think it should be safe . Travel advisory was after Jan
[12/3/24, 6:44:37 PM] ~ Ennamo Po: Question : is the domestic stamping still there ? If so what’s the criteria ?
[12/3/24, 6:44:49 PM] ~ Mark: Yeah, don't leave it until after Hitler gets in office, all bets are off then.
[12/3/24, 6:45:28 PM] ~ Rohit: I have been trying to get the dates for Dropbox. But not luck. Any help or suggestions you can give?
[12/3/24, 6:45:46 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: I can give you my Agents number
[12/3/24, 6:45:55 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: He was very quick - got me dates in 5 days
[12/3/24, 6:46:09 PM] ~ Ennamo Po: Hope it’s not a scam
[12/3/24, 6:46:26 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: No I checked on my portal
[12/3/24, 6:46:33 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: And he only takes money after the booking
[12/3/24, 6:46:45 PM] ~ Shuchi Batra: It was given to me by a very reliable friend
[12/3/24, 6:47:42 PM] ~ Rohit: DM you. If you can please share details. Thanks
[12/3/24, 6:47:55 PM] ~ Ennamo Po: Any idea on this ?

[12/4/24, 8:42:46 PM] ~ Mark: S Corp not allowed for foreign national.
[12/4/24, 8:45:07 PM] ~ 😀: So only LLC is option then?
[12/4/24, 8:51:42 PM] ~ Manish: S corporations have restrictions on who can be a shareholder, as well as limits on the total number of shareholders (no more than 100, and they must be either US citizens or residents). LLCs have no such restrictions.

[12/5/24, 12:18:27 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Hello Everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to say a heartfelt thank you to this incredible group for the resources, guidance, and instant inputs. Your collective knowledge has been invaluable throughout my journey.

A special shoutout to Sid for creating this amazing community—it’s been a game-changer for so many of us! 🙌

I’m thrilled to share that my H1B transfer was recently approved, with me being the majority shareholder in my company. It’s been quite a journey—I registered the company in October and started preparing the application in November.

Here’s to all of us breaking barriers and building dreams!
[12/5/24, 12:19:15 PM] ~ Prakash Verma: Congratulations 🎊
[12/5/24, 12:20:02 PM] ~ Nav: Wow! Congratulations
[12/5/24, 12:20:53 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: Thank you
[12/5/24, 12:22:19 PM] ~ Bala: Congratulations Maninder🎉🎊
[12/5/24, 12:24:18 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: You could consider Brex and Relay also
[12/5/24, 12:29:30 PM] ~ Siva: Congratulations maninder
[12/5/24, 12:38:58 PM] ~ Madhu: Congratulations 🎉
[12/5/24, 12:39:47 PM] ~ Abhi: From my experience, Wise needs a business account to perform transactions. 
It was not allowing me to connect my personal account for money transfer. 
I also looked at Square business account but it has a transaction limit initially.

Now I am trying Mercury and looks good so far.
[12/5/24, 12:51:29 PM] ~ Arun kg: Curious in what way Mercury, Wise etc are better as compared to the traditional banks?
[12/5/24, 12:52:33 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Slash for startups and New Business also up the Game
[12/5/24, 12:53:27 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Well there are certain organizations that might need your products or services that would prefer the traditional bank route
[12/5/24, 12:53:56 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: They would need your accounts to be domiciled in certain locations
[12/5/24, 12:54:19 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: And would request specific information and details

[12/5/24, 1:30:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: What’s your business btw?
[12/5/24, 1:31:55 PM] ~ Nav: Actually I was thinking we should use this group as a marketing strategy as well if your product is out there we will help to get the word out
[12/5/24, 2:45:15 PM] ~ Abhi: From my experience, the initial setup is easier.
[12/5/24, 3:11:51 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: Can confirm that Mercury was easy to set up especially if you use stripe Atlas. It has a promo and has some pre-populated information from your company registration

[12/5/24, 4:07:33 PM] ~ Vamsi: Hi all, does anyone know a business attorney who prepares the shareholder or Equity Ownership agreement, also known as the co-founder partnership agreement? I need this service urgently. If you have a trusted attorney, please let me know. Thanks for the support!

[12/5/24, 4:20:06 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: I am using Mercury, it is easy, simple and has no maintenance fee. But wire transfer is chargeable and does not have cheque system.
[12/5/24, 5:25:11 PM] ~ digvijaydharwa: Many Congratulations Maninder 🎉👏, did you have to somehow put a $1M into the business? I heard that it's a criterion somewhere, I could be wrong
[12/5/24, 5:36:35 PM] Sid Sarasvati: $1M as criterion for H1B? 
I think you might be confusing this with eb5 investor visa
[12/5/24, 5:39:06 PM] ~ Maninder Singh: No I did not😊
[12/5/24, 5:39:07 PM] ~ digvijaydharwa: I think you are right on that, I did get the two confused.
[12/5/24, 5:41:00 PM] ~ Vaibhav Shrivastav: I have asked this question before and @⁨~Achal Pandey⁩ replied to my message:

[12/6/24, 5:31:36 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Hi guys, quick question: to get my H1B stamped again do I have to go back to my home country or I can go to Canada and book an appointment at an embassy there? Thanks in advance!
[12/6/24, 5:48:10 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: You can usually get it done anywhere ... But make sure to check the embassy's website before you book an appointment
[12/6/24, 5:48:33 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Thank you!
[12/6/24, 5:48:43 PM] ~ Achal Pandey: For example during COVID most embassies had limited their availability to nationals of that country
[12/6/24, 5:49:18 PM] ~ Avi: Make sure they accept TCN - Third Country Nationals in that consulate before you travel/make an appointment. If they do, you can stamp it wherever ‎<This message was edited>
[12/6/24, 5:50:12 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Is there a list of TCN accepting embassies or I have to email the specific embassies and ask?
[12/6/24, 6:25:27 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: You can get it stamped in Canada, I got mine stamped in Ottawa early this year
[12/6/24, 6:30:28 PM] ~ Mark: I also like the Canadian set up....I always recommend Toronto...sometimes the booking is out a bit...but they are very good and even friendly in Toronto...

I can't tell you how much I appreciated being treated like a human being.

You can go in on a tourist visa at the border and that is the only status you need..
[12/6/24, 6:41:33 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Thanks all!
[12/6/24, 6:59:28 PM] ~ Avi: I don't think there is an updated centralized list as embassy/consulates from each country can change these rules at their discretion because depending on excess capacity, they may decide to open stamping for TCN, or not - so constantly monitoring that for your desired consulate is very important. Easiest is to keep checking their website. Alternatively you can call them and ask if they have phone number published. You can try with Caribbean countries, Canada, and Mexico to begin with
[12/6/24, 9:29:18 PM] ~ Mounish Kokkula: I completely agree with this. 
I recently got my stamping done in Montreal

[12/8/24, 4:34:51 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Came across an interesting stat

“only about 19% of businesses are incorporated. The rest are sole proprietorships, not because that’s the better option, but simply because most business owners are afraid of what they don’t understand.” 

From a 2022 book
[12/8/24, 4:35:44 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “According to the SBA, there are 31 million small businesses in the U.S. and they account for 99.9% of all the businesses in the country. 

They’re the lifeblood of the American economy, making up just about 50% of the GDP. 

In the last 20 years alone, small businesses created 10.5 million new jobs while larger enterprises only created 5.6 million. 

Small businesses make up 65% of all new jobs created and employ 47% of all private-sector employees.

[12/14/24, 8:28:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Advisor is tricky 
As it’s not necessarily a passive job 

Better if you can invest and act investor 

I guess the real paper trial is how you draw money 

If you get compensated as advisor 
What is that? Active income? 
If it is 
Then you have violated H1B
[12/14/24, 8:29:35 PM] Sid Sarasvati: If you get $$ as profit sharing 
That’s totally fine 
As that’s dividend 

I make dividend from my investment in apple stocks every quarter

[12/14/24, 10:09:51 PM] ~ Nik A: Is t that tricky ? So, you can take payment as k1. Advantage being you are on the paperwork. Disadvantage being you cannot do active work. Imo you can advise on the business process as long as you are not actively doing business. So you can advise on business when business is not about advising clients!
[12/14/24, 10:21:17 PM] ~ Ratan: K1?
[12/14/24, 10:23:29 PM] ~ Nik A: Stake holder in business and getting profit or dividend like sid said. K1 is the firm u get for tax filing. At least that is what I understood. Correct me if I am wrong lol
[12/15/24, 1:01:03 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Being an investor is what everyone in US on any visa can do 

The compliance issue are really about a) keep your existing visa compliant 
b) don’t break immigrant laws explicitly 

So for H1B, things become explicit when moneys moves into bank accounts 
When you file taxes you have paper records. You have declare all income 
I highly discourage being clever here 

Other than that - say I wrote code for my friends startup 5 years ago 

If I avoid legal title

How would you prove it? 

Anyway, IMO, USCIS is not playing a gotcha game 
They don’t want scam companies 
And they wanna be fair 

Lawyers says side hustle on H1B is a grey are - so for them they can’t legally advice you on what you can or cannot do. 

But if I’m an educated person I would also the following- 

If I code for my friends startup on the side while maintaining my H1B full time job - fully complaint 

What law did I break? 

There must be a section of law that this breaks 
I haven’t found one ‎<This message was edited>
[12/15/24, 1:11:20 AM] Sid Sarasvati: To be conservative you can fully avoid the grey area 
And the dread and fear that I know all visa holder have 

Maybe someone here who runs a side home rental / airbnb business can share more 

There are who do that in the US in H1B or h4
[12/15/24, 1:24:20 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Other than this I can only share my own experience. But you should ylam to a good lawyer who has done similar cases. There are many bad lawyers with worse advice. It’s the same with accounting. Same case with doctors. You need vet them. 

Hopefully this groups can at least make you think harder and not just stay resentful to ill fated green card situation for most H1B holders

[12/16/24, 2:05:12 PM] ~ digvijaydharwa: Hey! Yes, you can open a real estate company as LLC, only if you are looking to buy and rent the property. You cannot actively buy, revamp and sell as this will be categorized as active work. However, renting the space is allowed and is a passive income. If you have multiple properties, I understood that getting a property manager helps in justifying this as a passive income vs actively maintaining your properties which can be flagged as active work. 
So, as long as you prove that it's all a passive income without you working on it. I think we should be allowed.
[12/16/24, 2:17:59 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The categorization of “active” vs “passive” work comes from IRS 

You have FICA tax on active income + other rules 

Passive income is taxed just your marginal rate 

+ there are income offset rules from losses that applies to these 2 types of income 

So IRS expects you to report your income accordingly
[12/16/24, 2:19:20 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Outside of this I don’t know how USCIS by itself can come and tell you what they think is passive vs active work 

The chatter on this topic is very weird to me especially on online forums 
Once you understand the law and these departments well ‎<This message was edited>

[12/17/24, 2:46:43 PM] ~ Manish: > DHS is also clarifying that certain owners of the petitioning entity may be eligible for H-1B status (“beneficiary-owners”), while setting reasonable parameters around H-1B eligibility when the beneficiary owns a controlling interest in the petitioning entity. For example, USCIS will limit the validity of the initial H-1B petition and first extension to 18 months each. See new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(9)(iii)(E).

> Specifically, DHS is adding to new 8 CFR 214.2(h)(4)(ii) and (h)(9)(iii)(E), that a controlling interest means that the  beneficiary owns more than 50 percent of the petitioner or that the beneficiary has majority voting rights in the petitioner. 

from the final rule in the federal register https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-29354.pdf

[12/18/24, 12:32:45 AM] ~ Avi: Try this - https://checkvisaslots.com/ if you are okay going India route.  They have a browser addon and if you are patient for a few days/checking at odd times, you can likely get one soon. This addon is free but if you like it, I would def suggest getting a subscription to support their developers. For non-India route, I have recently came across some consulates across various countries have started accepting TCN - third country nationals. I'd highly recommend that to check their website if they accept TCNs before you travel/book appointment
[12/18/24, 12:33:32 AM] ~ Ennamo Po: Thanks seems like going to India will be best ?
[12/18/24, 12:36:03 AM] ~ Avi: Yes, assuming you are okay with 2 to 3 weeks of wait after submitting your passport. Also a trick to get it even more quicker by at least 3 or 4 days is to visit Chennai dropoff site (assuming all the Dropbox appointments are centralized there). That way you skip the part where your passport physically travels through mail in their network. It is not overnight shipping in my observation ‎<This message was edited>

[12/18/24, 8:19:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Initial H1B is “18 months”
That’s interesting 
Typically you get H1B for 3 years 
They made a explicit case for business owners now 
With 18 month 
Likely because they want to check the documents again
[12/18/24, 8:22:26 AM] Sid Sarasvati: In my case, even with majority stake, I provided employer-employee relationship 
So it was a typical H1B 

It’ll be interesting if someone here can find out what would happen now with this new rule 

To me it appears nothing changes for employee-employer relationship style H1B (even if you have ownership) 

But for owner H1B, there is a new 18 month initial H1B provision which will could helpful for many just starting out
[12/18/24, 8:23:11 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I’ll see if I can bring my precious attorney back again for the monthly call on this topic

You can also upload your incorporation. documents to chatGPT and ask for suggestions. Sometimes just another documentation should suffice. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/22/24, 1:22:39 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: What are some attorneys that are helping with everything
[12/22/24, 1:51:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Why do you need a board? 
As in what are you trying to achieve or protect? It’s not clear from your question 

If you are owner, you can be an owner. Your immigration status doesn’t matter. 
Think of it as investment in stock market or private investment in a startup. You are allowed. 

The income you make will be considered passive from tax purposes. So don’t work actively for it by taking a role or official title
[12/22/24, 1:53:44 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Welcome new folks 

I’m hoping to schedule a monthly call before the year ends 
Likely after Christmas 

We have had few folks who successfully got their H1B through their business 
So I’m hoping they can join and share the story 

I’ll try and lock it a date / time tomorrow

[12/22/24, 2:05:00 PM] ~ Tushar A: We went through this recently. 

You don’t need board of directors.  Aa did mentioned you can be listed as owner. And in the other fields where it says titles, don’t add yourself if you are on H1B with another company.
[12/22/24, 2:05:39 PM] ~ Tushar A: We have 2 H1B owners and 1 GC guy. Everything was on GC guy as title of CEO, but ownership is divided differently.

[12/22/24, 2:09:34 PM] ~ Kaiwan: What is I-140.? Is this approval Visa?
[12/22/24, 2:11:45 PM] ~ Kaiwan: So if i use premium processing. Still i have to wait for 2..3 years?

[12/23/24, 2:38:13 PM] ~ Nav: Congratulations man 🎉
[12/23/24, 2:42:50 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Thank you. 
I wrote a bit about it here - https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/week-5252-2024-renovate-ai-closes-year-ranked-29-us-design-sarasvati-mrmje/?trackingId=8gtoJHRGRKGr%2FQmhWe5b2A%3D%3D

But let me expand a bit: 

One thing a bootstrapped business forces you to do is be extremely careful with spending. You have to earn to spend. This makes you a) not grow and hire a team unless you need to b) be cautious with vendors or overcommiting to long cycles etc 

I think not having VC money in the bank helped in my case. I bet if I was in my 20s, I would have taken the check. Or moved to silicon valley to raise 10x - 20x funding. That for sure would have been a mistake. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/23/24, 2:46:38 PM] Sid Sarasvati: This may not be the case for other B2B or B2C models but I think more people need to share non VC backed startup stories. ‎<This message was edited>

Can anyone recommend a good H1B immigration lawyer in India? I don’t currently have an H1B visa, and I realize this group may be more focused on those who already have one and are looking to switch as founders under H1B. 

I’m willing to pay for a consultation if it aligns with what I’m looking for. I’m not seeking a step-by-step explanation of the process. I need someone who can deliver results and help me navigate what’s actually required to get things done. Most consultants I’ve spoken to so far are focused on explaining the process rather than get things going. 
Thanks in advance!

Regard,
Neha

[12/29/24, 1:56:13 PM] ~ RJ: Hi all, What's the best state to register a company? Wyoming or Delaware? Wondering what's the best site to open LLC? I heard about legalzoom but am looking for any feedback or websites. Thank you!
[12/29/24, 2:29:49 PM] ~ Sam: The best state to register is where you stay as it makes filing taxes and everything else easy end of the year. But there is nothing stopping from opening an llc in Wyoming and Delaware to take benefits they offer. There is lot of chatter on this by  instagram influencers without going too deep into this topic. Wyoming - helps in keeping the owner anonymous (with BOI filing - this goes out of the gate)
Delaware - no tax/low tax for corps (again payroll taxes are different) 

For founders and startups - it doesn’t make much difference unless there is lots of capital and employees involved. But for larger entities and holding companies options like Wyoming and Delaware do matter.
[12/29/24, 2:31:01 PM] ~ Sam: Please do your due diligence and speak to your CPA for additional  guidance
[12/29/24, 2:32:07 PM] ~ RJ: Thank you!
[12/29/24, 2:36:51 PM] ~ Sam: Want to state one more thing - you can always move things around once your business grows. For example - Apple may have its headquarters in California but it moved to Ireland (a completely different country) to save billions in taxes ‎<This message was edited>

[1/1/25, 2:03:44 AM] ~ Mohammed Contractor: I just got my Incorporation certificate from Delaware. I am in Seattle, so I also had to register a foreign entity (which in my case is the HQ)
[1/1/25, 2:05:35 AM] ~ Sam: You should not have majority in the board. That’s the main logic. Meaning - you or your family members should not be the only persons available in the board. Let’s say you have 3 people and 
Case1: 
1- you
2-your husband
3-your friend 
Case2: 
1- you
2-your friend1
3-your friend2 
Case2 is what a good example looks like where they can vote you out of the company and establishes employer-employee relationship perfectly according to USCIS ‎<This message was edited>

[1/1/25, 2:06:28 AM] ~ Deepali: Thanks! Makes sense now. I have another H-1B friend who will be a co-founder and one USC citizen, looks like I’ll go ahead with it
[1/1/25, 2:14:44 AM] ~ Sam: That sounds good. Always do your due diligence and make sure you have trusted people in the board. Please refer to Sam Altman case from OpenAI and even Steve Jobs case before. While board seems to be a no-brainer, board members play a very powerful role. Once the organizing becomes successful, everyone one wants a piece of pie and easily they can oust anyone. You can still continue to enjoy the equity but you cannot control many things once you are ousted. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/2/25, 2:17:05 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hey folks - I am looking for a social media manager 
It’s important to have good aesthetic eyes + interest in growing brand socials and messaging. 
Let me know if you are interested or have anyone you can recommend.

[1/2/25, 3:58:42 PM] ~ Aadil Hussaini: Hey friends, joined the community late. Has there been any info shared on lawyer recommendations (didn’t find any info on Sid’s website or the recorded talks) . Please share if you have any recs 

Also pro-tip some of you might know: apply for “Microsoft for startups” before incorporation . It’s easy to get into, and provides a bunch of benefits like $25k azure credits, credits for mercury banking, and 50% off stripe atlas. I’ll be using stripe atlas this week to incorporate my Delaware  C-corp
[1/2/25, 4:01:33 PM] ~ Aadil Hussaini: For pledged investments, does Uscis want to see money in the bank account, or a signed document by angel investors work? 

I’m planning to use YC’s SAFE document and get it signed by a few friends / family members to show around $100k-$200k pledged, and transfer some of my own savings once I have mercury account. 

Is that a good move? What have others done? Seems like @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ had invested his own savings that worked for him.
[1/2/25, 4:37:12 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Welcome Aadil. Great tip on Microsoft for startups credits. 
There is also OpenAI and AI vendors credits that businesses can apply to. I highly recommend you fill those forms. It doesn’t take much time. They are doing their customer aquisition so it’s a not a favor. Be a good customer and take their free discount 🙂

[1/3/25, 12:52:31 AM] ~ Manish: Is there a reason why you choosing sole proprietorship? It comes with uncapped liabilities compared to limited in LLC?

[1/3/25, 9:21:42 AM] ~ Sam: yes, this was discussed earlier
[1/3/25, 9:22:17 AM] ~ Sam: You should not have majority in the board. That’s the main logic. Meaning - you or your family members should not be the only persons available in the board. Let’s say you have 3 people and 
Case1: 
1- you
2-your husband
3-your friend

1- you
2-your friend1

[1/4/25, 12:53:12 PM] ~ Kaushal: Hi Friends, Need your help. 

I am applying for my L1A visa and require an office space agreement. This agreement would involve either the owner or a current tenant subleasing office space to me for a nominal fee for one year. I will need photos of the space and evidence that the subletting party has the right to sublease. I need documentation for two seats. 

An alternative is to obtain this from a WeWork or similar provider. However, I will not physically occupy the space, so I am looking for more cost-effective options. Do you know anyone who has co-working or office space and could provide me with such a letter? I will not be physically present at the space. Upon arrival in the US, I will update the company information with USCIS with the actual office address. So this is just a letter requirement. Let me know if you know someone who can provide this letter or if there are some other alternatives.

I understand that the work performed by was contractual in nature.However, according to the IRS, payments to independent contractors and freelancers are typically reported on a 1099-MISC form if the payments exceed $600 in a calendar year.Since our payment was $2,000, I would like to confirm whether we need to issue a 1099-MISC form for this payment.
[1/4/25, 8:46:56 PM] ~ amreen: You're right, we do have bank records and invoices that serve as proof of payment.

[1/4/25, 11:16:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I paid over $300K to vendors and services for 2024
You don’t need 1099 for businesses you need invoice and bookkeeping 
All my payments are via bank - credit card or wire 
Or I use ramp which helps with uploading receipts etc 

Then this needs to go in bookkeeping software as expense 
I used puzzle.io 


For US contracts if you pay them hourly. You will need to issue 1099 
I use gusto for individual contractor payment and it takes care of that 
$12 / person / month 

For intentional contractors you need to to issue 1099 
But you should do bookkeeping 
If you get audited, you must show that you had that expense for a service
[1/4/25, 11:18:32 PM] Sid Sarasvati: If you ever run ads - meta or google 
It’s the same thing. You don’t issue 1099 to them, do you? 
They are vendors, they invoice and you pay 
You make sure to record expense ‎<This message was edited>
[1/5/25, 7:31:57 AM] ~ Shyam BV: What if the the individual contractor is international and not a business? Same 1099 works there as well?
[1/5/25, 11:27:59 AM] Sid Sarasvati: No 
I directly through mercury bill pay 
Upload invoice 
They need to enter their bank details - mercury handles that 
$0 fee 

For some where I have to pay regularly I add them as international contractor on gusto 
That’s free as well - I think 

The only form gusto makes them fill is the one that’s ensure they are really foreign - I forget the name 
But no 1099
1099 is for US taxes 
The international person is responsible for filing their own taxes 
You could make the clear on your contract for individuals

F1 to H1b (picked already) with 100% ownership and they are charging $6250 

I am trying to see if I can get this any cheaper
[1/7/25, 11:18:51 AM] ~ Kishan: Is this the standard lawyer fee? Accross
[1/7/25, 11:32:19 AM] Sid Sarasvati: for starters you can subtract the h1b fee that USCIS needs + premium fee if you opt for it 
so then you can see what is the extra they are charging 

last I checked the h1b fee with premium alone came close to $3-4K

[1/7/25, 12:03:21 PM] ~ Kishan: The premium fee and application fee was separate and that’s ~ $4000

In total selfsponsoring h1b is coming upto 10.5k
[1/7/25, 12:09:27 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Amazing 🤩
[1/7/25, 12:10:53 PM] ~ Sahitya: Serotte is more cost effective. Their fee was around 7k including government fees
[1/7/25, 1:43:28 PM] ~ Kishan: I think even that is a bit expensive for a company that’s yet to make revenue 

Makes sense if you’re already making money- has anyone thought of doing it with out a lawyer ? LLMs can draft but all it needs is someone to verify things
[1/7/25, 2:04:14 PM] ~ Mahesh Rangholiya: @⁨~Kishan⁩ Did you file/sponsor your own H1B when you say "with 100% ownership"? Sorry....if this is already answered anywhere. Thanks!
[1/7/25, 2:20:42 PM] ~ Kishan: I did not! I’ve done my B1 and F1 COS they are generally not intense - I need to look into the possibilities for H1B but not totally sure.
[1/7/25, 2:24:06 PM] ~ Kishan: But it make sense if this is possible many h1b holders can bring their products to the market easily and use money to build rather waste on admin costs

[1/8/25, 9:25:54 AM] ~ Tushar A: The details that the guy mentioned didn’t cover all the conditions. You can’t just sponsor your H1B because you have a company. 50% majority rule is changed, but again you need revenue on your company before you can sponsor your H1B. The guy makes it sound like - anyone can do it, just coz they have a company.

[1/8/25, 10:09:16 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes, the upgrades are good. What we use to call “gray area” is becoming more clear - but yet to be finalized.

Is it okay to get stamping done in Japan due to less wait time or am I required to travel to India and get it done there as it’s the first time?
[1/8/25, 5:01:13 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Would recommend emailing this to embassy in Japan
[1/8/25, 5:05:31 PM] ~ Devesh: TCN (third country national) first time stamping policy differs from embassy to embassy. I got mine in Frankfurt without issue a couple years ago but only after written email confirmation from them.
[1/8/25, 5:06:50 PM] ~ Harsh Banthia: Understood, I will email them. Thank you 🙏
[1/8/25, 5:09:07 PM] ~ Devesh: You’d need a japan visa covering the whole trip duration as well. Not sure how long Japan tourist visas are but would also recommend sorting that out in parallel.
[1/8/25, 5:13:20 PM] ~ Harsh Banthia: Yes certainly. I currently live and do business in Hawaii, family members often apply for Japan tourist e-visa, it’s fairly quick (2-3) days.
[1/8/25, 5:15:19 PM] ~ Harsh Banthia: Usual validity is 90 days
[1/8/25, 6:02:26 PM] ~ Kalyan: If you are living there and have resident card 
You can simply just fill ds160 and go for stamping there , no need to send mail and get it confirmed

[1/9/25, 10:27:13 AM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Hello All - Can someone share a high level list of documents needed for H1B filing, something that an attorney would ask? I understand you need bank statements for the business account, company structure, cash flow/contracts in case of a B2B? What are other bare minimum? @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ I am not sure if we had these answered at the serotte podcast back in October? I am trying to create a checklist of items. TIA
[1/9/25, 10:53:24 AM] Sid Sarasvati: The reasons there is no definite answer is because it depends 
A lot of this is case making and e attorney helps strengthen it by adding more and more evidence 

So for a SaaS business like mine: 
- regular H1B docs 
- ⁠cap table (simple spreadsheet you can make) 
- ⁠duns number 
- ⁠bank statement 
- ⁠incorporation doc 
- ⁠board agreement showing board  members. Your attorney will then make the case in writing. That’s what you paying them for
[1/9/25, 10:56:01 AM] ~ Yash: Hey Sid, just a quick question, what about funding information? Should we show investments? and also budgeting?
[1/9/25, 11:02:06 AM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Thanks Sid! That makes sense. Sorry what is a duns number ?? Also, in your experience is cash flow/client contracts better compared to investment/hard cash in the account?
[1/9/25, 11:46:57 AM] ~ Sahitya: DUNS number is mandatory now only if the company has made revenue or borrowed a line of credit. It wasn’t required for our filing a month back

It helps assess a company's creditworthiness and financial health and is often required for government contracts, grants, or partnerships with other businesses.

To obtain a DUNS number, check if your business already has one using Dun & Bradstreet's lookup tool. If not, apply online by providing your business details. The process is free but may take up to 30 days unless expedited for a fee.

You have to be able to pay H1B salary which means you have to have funds
Doesn’t have to be revenue 
But you needs funds in the business bank account from investor or self or f&f 

With some funds + potential business clients in future and a plan, a case can be made
[1/15/25, 5:35:27 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: Thanks for the response, how much funds are required? Can you suggest any multiple of yearly salary?
[1/15/25, 5:36:37 PM] Sid Sarasvati: 1x yearly salary is good enough for most cases

[1/15/25, 5:38:56 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Revenue is what makes you business legit 
It’s not just salary

[1/15/25, 5:50:03 PM] ~ Kishan: I spoke with few lawyers so far - its been quite subjective so far with the funds questions — ideally its 18 months worth of salary - some mentioned they did it 1 year and some mentioned 6 months 

but its going to be trail and error — end of the day you are convincing USCIS by showing money, MVP or traction or something else 

money does not need convincing  — if you are on CPT its worth taking some risk to understand the nuances — I am on the same route CPT - H1B
[1/15/25, 5:51:18 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: Thanks for the details..

[1/15/25, 5:54:14 PM] ~ Mahesh Rangholiya: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ and EVERYONE, If I  buy an "existing" business which has a revenue and a decent cashflow as well plus if I'm able to show 18 months salary+expenses as well. What do you think are the chances of getting this approved? Again, no guarantees but what would be your confidence level on this? I'm thinking of acquiring a business for my wife and filing her concurrent H1B in that business. Appreciate your time and help in advance. Thanks!
[1/15/25, 6:06:45 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I think that’s a good idea

Now - the key for you on H1B front is to create the appropriate job offer for the employee you want to hire (that’s your wife) 
So same H1B rules apply as with any H1B transfer 
It should relevant to field of study 

Lawyers can help with details of employer - employee relationship which is always doable
[1/15/25, 6:20:42 PM] ~ Mahesh Rangholiya: Thanks for the quick response!

This is not for my H1B....I will be staying on H4-EAD and planning to acquire the business with my 401k funds. And then hire my wife as part-time employee/founder with concurrent H1B.
[1/15/25, 6:22:45 PM] ~ PARTH RANA: Can i ask which kind of business you are planning to acquire? Are there any websites for legit listings?
[1/15/25, 6:23:06 PM] ~ Kishan: then maybe making that employer part of the your company to hire you could work on cpt - even if you own the company some one must supervise you.

[1/16/25, 10:36:59 AM] ~ Abhi: I have also heard about Cursor ai. Wondering if you have tried it
[1/16/25, 11:00:55 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Claude so far has been majorly used and quite happy with performance.

Deepseek is good too, but requires lot of RAM, trying to find way around.

Like cursor, windsurf is another alternative. Good part with windsurf is one can use local LLM. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/16/25, 11:07:32 AM] ~ Kishan: any local LLM you think is as good as sonnet 3.5 or gpt 4? ‎<This message was edited>
[1/16/25, 11:08:31 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Devin,  Google models, Open AI new models will be good for year but then those in development will find alternative and get better performance and local. That means cost will keep falling if Google or OpenAI are to survive.

With NVIDIA Blackwell Digits coming, many big companies are going to get run for their money.

Even with free GitHub Copilot still my 2 cents is Claude, local LLM like Deepseek way better as far as Development is concerned. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/16/25, 11:43:42 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That’ll be cool. I think the future is more like local and private ‘AI Agents’ 
Likely to see some of it coming this year. 

This is good book if you are looking to grok AI agents - it’s WIP but you can already start reading it. 

https://www.manning.com/books/ai-agents-in-action
[1/16/25, 11:47:52 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Here is my fun analogy for AI agents: 

So have you seen the movie Memento? [Christopher Nolan] 
For those who haven’t - it’s Gajni the indian movie. 
The guy doesn’t have short term memory. Forgets everything within 15 mins [or each run], and each morning he tries to remember everything that happened before looking at this tattoos and markets [memory + context window] 

That’s how LLM’s work. They are stateless. So to have this illusion of an agent that can step by step complete a task. You have to tattoo it’s body with context on each run. Every time the LLM runs, it’s start blank, reads what happened in last run, starts from there. 

Coding this all up into a cohesive framework is the fun engineering challenge of this era. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/16/25, 12:22:13 PM] ~ PN: What tools did you use for Renovate, @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ ?
[1/16/25, 12:41:28 PM] ~ Prajwal Pitlehra: Hi Everyone,

First and foremost, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ for creating this amazing community, and to all of you for making it such a valuable space for insights and support. Your collective knowledge and experience have already been incredibly helpful in navigating some of the complexities of being a founder on OPT.

I wanted to share an update about my journey and seek your guidance. I’ve recently started a company that has already secured pre-seed funding, which will be used to pay my salary as well as cover operational and legal costs. As of now, I hold 90% equity in the company. I’m currently on OPT, working as a financial analyst, and I plan to apply for my STEM Extension soon.

However, I’ve heard that pursuing a startup while on the STEM Extension can be quite challenging.

One option I’m considering is applying for my STEM Extension with my current employer to simplify things. This would allow me more time to strengthen my startup’s compliance and structure. Additionally, I’m exploring whether my startup can sponsor my H1B or O1 visa in the future.

Given the complexities of my situation, I’m eager to hear your thoughts, experiences, or any potential pitfalls I should watch out for. Have any of you navigated something similar, or do you know someone who has?

I truly appreciate any insights or advice you can provide. Feel free to reach out here or privately if that’s easier.

Thank you all for your time and support!
[1/16/25, 1:10:21 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s awesome @⁨~Prajwal Pitlehra⁩ 
Bravo
[1/16/25, 1:11:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I think you should consult an attorney at this point 
You have most things ready to go 

Shoot me a quick email at sid@trialanderror.ai 
I’ll connect you with Serotte law
[1/16/25, 1:37:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: what do you mean by tools? as an which AI model? 
We have a pipeline of them + some custom fine tuning
[1/16/25, 2:07:08 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: If I understand above post, you can get STEM OPT.

OPT is for 1 year and extension is my understanding, however, was on OPT a long time ago.

One option could be you start company in name of family member and work in company.

Company 50 or 90% stake, what matters to University DSO is genuine work, right?

Even if your H1 lottery gets picked or not, you can work in your own company on STEM OPT for 2.5 or so years, while others immigration matters get sorted out?

Just 2 cents. Attorney can give more ideas. ‎<This message was edited>

[1/20/25, 6:12:29 AM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: It’s possible
[1/20/25, 11:24:10 AM] Sid Sarasvati: You should 
It’s just documentation 
You don’t have file it anywhere 

Download the pdf 
Fill it in 10 mins 
Keep it in drive just in case 

It becomes more important to do after e-verify 
Then you need to file and submit it
[1/20/25, 11:25:08 AM] Sid Sarasvati: So - there is no “filing” 

It’s like - I need to raise my salary, do I give myself a new offer letter? 

You can answer that
[1/20/25, 1:36:40 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: Got it - thank you! Once i9 is filed, in my case, I also have to file everify which is not a problem. 

Can I check whether I can show employer employer relationship if my company is a LLC and I am a member (minority)? So can the llc also hire me for day to day ops and pay me a salary even if I am a member? I know for c corp you can but since LLC is a pass thru entity I was not sure
[1/20/25, 1:58:13 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: LLC can hire you and have employer employee relationship too
[1/20/25, 1:58:52 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Pass through is for taxation purpose, LLC is also a legal entity that can hire & fire people

[1/20/25, 2:58:38 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: LLC or C Corp are entity for Taxation purpose as mentioned above.

For immigration, that is, H1 hiring both are majorly the same, that is, a Legal Entity with EIN. One can have Board of Directors who can hire fire.
[1/20/25, 3:20:58 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hi Ritika - I still don’t understand what you mean when you say I9 if “filed” 

I9 is a form the employer needs to fill after employment 
This makes sure that that the employer is right documentations 
There is no filing 
I think it’s important we use the right terms to avoid confusion ‎<This message was edited>
[1/20/25, 3:23:22 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes 
LLC are state entity 
They have the flexibility of operating like a c-corp as well - so same tax laws etc 

LLC can hire H1B as well 

In my coaching calls I often recommend not having a pass through entity 
This way you keep company tax returns completely separate from personal tax returns until your H1B gets sorted 

But it depends on your situation

[1/21/25, 6:38:16 AM] ~ Ritika Patni: Can LLC also have a board of directors that can hire or fire? My understanding was that there is no concept of board of directors in a LLC
[1/21/25, 6:39:17 AM] ~ Ritika Patni: Noted, can a LLC that elects to be taxed as a C corp achieve the same?
[1/21/25, 6:41:00 AM] Sid Sarasvati: 💯
[1/21/25, 7:38:51 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: As you mentioned is also correct.

My 2 cents. You can confirm from CPA

Management structure
LLC Management

a. Member-Managed: All members participate in running the business.

b. Manager-Managed: Designated managers (who may or may not be members) run the business

c. Board of Managers: Some LLCs create a board of managers, similar to a board of directors, to oversee the company.

If majorly stake then might not require, if Minority stake or no stake in LLC by having Board of Directors one can show Employee Employer relationship -  ability to hire and fire ‎<This message was edited>
[1/21/25, 10:25:17 AM] ~ Ritika Patni: Thanks, Kartik! Very helpful. 

If you have a minority stake in the company, what sort of role can you take to show employer employee relationship? Can you still claim to be founder? I am effectively looking at a two person LLC with the other person being the majority owner. I am not sure what designation is appropriate
[1/21/25, 11:49:37 AM] ~ Ritika Patni: Is title of CEO a problem if you are trying to show employer employee relationship in a 2 person LLC?
[1/21/25, 1:46:21 PM] Sid Sarasvati: No not a problem at all 
CEOs can be fired 

However, you have to get you salary match the lca minimum 
So you can be flexible here 
You still be a founder on LinkedIn 
While your company title is something else
[1/21/25, 1:52:04 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: Thanks Sid
[1/21/25, 1:52:10 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: What is LCA minimum
[1/21/25, 2:01:14 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Depends on title and location

[1/21/25, 2:47:33 PM] ~ Prajwal Pitlehra: I have a question about compliance under STEM OPT. Since I’m currently on OPT, I need a supervisor to meet the requirements.

My lawyer has advised against taking the CEO role for compliance purposes. Instead, I’m considering titles like Founder & CTO, with >50% equity. Does the supervisor I “report to” on paper need to have equity as well, or can they hold 0% or <1% equity?

Given that I’m the only one on the team and the founder, are there other suitable roles or titles I should consider while structuring this setup?
[1/21/25, 3:03:56 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Let’s go over this in the call today

[1/21/25, 7:57:09 PM] ~ Kishan: For the people who are on h1b 100% ownership - pre revenue stage — you are paying yourself the prevailing wage? If so technically you are losing ~25% of that on taxes by running payroll 

Is there any other way someone convinced USCIS to not pay their prevailing wage for example show traction or general runway?
[1/21/25, 8:06:48 PM] Sid Sarasvati: How are you loosing 25%? 

This absolutely incorrect information
[1/21/25, 8:09:16 PM] Sid Sarasvati: If you referring to payroll taxes 
Then yes - you have to pay 6.5% both as employer and employer 

But if you think you can avoid it by just taking money outside of payroll, you are underestimating IRS 

There is a 12.5% self employment taxes for those who pay themselves as proprietor I.e outside of payroll 

That said - the other way is profit sharing to derive money out 

That has other implications which eventually comes down to mixing it up with payroll a bit 

So it comes down to overall strategy 

It’s not black and white
[1/21/25, 8:10:16 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Why ya’ll so specific about Taxes?
[1/21/25, 8:10:42 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That said - H1B needs to be on payroll 
There is no “loosing money” here 
That’s what H1B employment means 
You need to pay payroll taxes and provide w2

[1/21/25, 8:46:37 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Thanks for adding me, Sid! Hey guys, my name is sandeep somisetty. I am a corporate attorney and live in California. Have a side gig in the works and would love to learn more about the founders H1B. Good to meet you all.
[1/21/25, 8:47:15 PM] ~ Kishan: Yeah, I was referring to the total tax burden on an H-1B salary (22-27%) depending on the state and wage level.

I’m specifically talking about a pre-revenue, bootstrapped startup where the H-1B founder is required to pay themselves the prevailing wage. This creates an initial financial burden until the company generates revenue or reaches product-market fit.

Is there any legal way to structure compensation differently in the early stages to ease this burden while remaining compliant?
[1/21/25, 9:21:27 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: As mentioned earlier, not sure *money loss".

Can on payroll, 401k in part, health insurance in part, instead of all in salary or similar?

Taxable income goes down n money in your bank rather than IRS. Lower tax slab means lower tax payment, right?

Check with CPA many ways, legal ways to save on taxes using tax deductibles.

That said, every situation can be different. So, consult a CPA, lot of online CPAs on reputed portals. ‎<This message was edited>

Option - take a lower title and pay less 
Option 2 - go for O1 visa

It just means you don’t have enough money to pay yourself much

I just paid myself this cycle, using a 3rd party payroll system that does my federal and state withholding and employer tax. $4200 went out of my business account, and I received ~$2700 ish in my personal. Roughly 35% went to taxes. This is a lot more expensive than I thought
[1/22/25, 10:12:48 PM] ~ Linda: Please anyone help me out if I’m doing this wrong

[1/22/25, 11:31:01 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Do you use Tax deductibles like Healthcare, 401k?

401k is deferred tax, Healthcare is mandatory so maybe instead of salary use those and other deductibles. Low tax bracket means lower taxes to Federal and State govt

https://www.freshbooks.com/hub/taxes/tax-write-offs-for-llc#llc-tax-deductions

Just my 2 cents.
CPA can be consulted as tax wide area and interpretations. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/23/25, 1:37:36 PM] Sid Sarasvati: 35% hmm 
check your withholdings, you must have filled a w4 from 
but for a single tax filer 25-35% effective tax rate is not unheard.
[1/23/25, 1:38:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: federal alone would be 20% then you add state and FICA
[1/23/25, 1:38:32 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The goal for you is to create business expense 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>

[1/26/25, 6:53:52 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Guys, I have a very fundamental (or dumb) question: if my startup were to sponsor my h1b, will it be cap exempt if the employer otherwise doesn’t qualify under cap exempt category (like not a non profit, etc.) I suspect no but wanted to be certain. Thanks in advance!
[1/26/25, 7:05:29 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: I run a For Profit Company

[1/26/25, 8:59:57 PM] Haluk Gul: Hey guys, quick question if there are other F1 students here, can I create an llc and do my CPT there? Would be happy to connect anyone who's an F1 looking to pursue his business and self sponsor too. Thanks.
[1/26/25, 9:03:53 PM] ~ Mark: No...can't create an opportunity on F1, only H1b.
[1/26/25, 9:04:58 PM] Haluk Gul: So does it make sense to finish the program, get on a job with OPT, then open the llc after school?
[1/26/25, 9:05:23 PM] ~ Mark: Yes...
[1/26/25, 9:06:01 PM] ~ Mark: There are some good gap rules now between F1 and H1b...
[1/26/25, 9:06:48 PM] Haluk Gul: I've been searching for the past 2 weeks and came to the same conclusion.. it'll take a few years before I do it, but by that time the ai automation wave (the area I'm working on) will be mostly saturated ‎<This message was edited>
[1/26/25, 9:07:12 PM] Haluk Gul: Thanks for the heads up
[1/26/25, 9:08:09 PM] ~ Mark: Good luck.
[1/26/25, 10:02:22 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You won’t be cap exempt by default 
So likely not
[1/26/25, 10:03:27 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Not sure about CPT. Likely not 

But you own and work on OPT 
OPT extension though where it gets tricky. Tricker than H1B
[1/26/25, 10:05:39 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I don’t know if  “ai automation will be saturated” is the  right narrative 

Internet boom started around 1994 
It was saturated around dot com bubble - 1999 - 20021

That exactly the time when google and many other foundational companies were born 

So the idea of saturation is really a capital investment idea 

Nothing to do with fundamentals and raw market ‎<This message was edited>

[1/26/25, 10:15:19 PM] Haluk Gul: agree with most of your points, it just hurts to not be able to be one of the first movers despite being aware and capable of doing this business model. it's like watching a ship sail from the harbor and trying to catch it after a 5 minute headstart :)
[1/26/25, 10:17:25 PM] Haluk Gul: my followup plan is to create such amazing systems (connecting with university alumni and building it out) so that companies give a cpt and help out with the tuition (that looks like the best plan in this situation anyway)
[1/26/25, 10:17:59 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Nothing stops you from building right now 
Unless you have other obligation that takes time away 

I had a full time job while I built renovate ai for 2 years - started oct 2022 

Sponsored my H1B march 2024
[1/26/25, 10:19:27 PM] Haluk Gul: yea your story really inspired me to take this route - i can use these two years to build a following with podcasts + newsletters + advance my craft so that when the time is right i can just go into it straight away with a ready customer base + right connections + brand value
[1/26/25, 10:20:03 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Good to know, thanks. My employer has sponsored me for the lottery for the last three years but I haven’t had any luck with the H1b. So this won’t really be any additional help, I guess.
[1/26/25, 10:20:18 PM] Haluk Gul: i have no kids or family to support so no problem with time + focus + life energy :)
[1/26/25, 10:22:43 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes 
Go for it 

Business is hard. You will be full of doubts 
I am here to tell you that everything else is easier 
Build a business first 
You will sort out immigration. Don’t let immigration issue add onto the already tough path of entrepreneurship 

That’s why I started this group. Doubt is the only thing keeping you from going for it. ‎<This message was edited>
[1/26/25, 10:25:41 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: Spot on. Build a business first. Rest is administrative challenge.

Getting a customer to pay you their hard earned money is by far the biggest challenge in setting up a business.
[1/26/25, 10:25:48 PM] ~ Vikram Shete: Solve that and you are sorted.
[1/26/25, 10:37:23 PM] Haluk Gul: Thank you so much, appreciate it a lot. Glad i joined a group of people with similar mindset. Feels like I'm the only person in the university who's trying to do any of this lol. Will definitely stop worrying about the immigration stuff and focus on building the business + brand + systems etc. Seeing someone do it really helps, i'll just get back to work and keep at it 🙏

It loads my RAM with a ton of distractors and my attention can't focus properly and fully on the highest priority work item. After a few hours, get lunch and optionally gather world state.”

[1/28/25, 11:36:10 AM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Naah, am a corporate lawyer at a big firm. I have an offer of being a co founder at an angel funded legal tech startup. So I was considering this route. But looks like it’s going to be a lottery anyway. So not super helpful to me
[1/28/25, 11:36:55 AM] ~ Adi: Have you considered O1?

[1/28/25, 11:46:59 AM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Yeah. But I understand O1 is tied to the employer. Will need O1s from both employers. And I need to seek approval from ny employer to work as an entrepreneur. All very complicated.
[1/28/25, 11:47:09 AM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Appreciate the input, nonetheless!

[1/28/25, 11:49:53 AM] ~ Adi: Sorry for spamming the H1B group with O1 information .
@⁨~Sandeep Somisetty⁩ there is a way where you can file O1 as self sponsor and still work for your current employer while you also can work on your start up in your own field

[1/29/25, 1:05:32 PM] Sheekha Khetan (H1B Founders): If you have 2 concurrent H1-Bs, during the stamping process which one do you use? Do you have to provide both?
[1/29/25, 1:10:27 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: I have 2 concurrent h1bs. One with a non profit(that's the stamped visa on passport) the other one is filed but it's not stamped on passport
[1/29/25, 1:13:11 PM] Sheekha Khetan (H1B Founders): When you filled DS160, did you only provide the nonprofit H1B details?
[1/29/25, 1:14:19 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Yes! The concurrent H1B was filed after my passport was stamped and I arrived in US

[1/29/25, 6:21:24 PM] ~ Suresh Gaddala: Yes my name is suresh and I know them personally and they got approvals for some of the complicated H1B  cases
[1/29/25, 6:21:57 PM] ~ Suresh Gaddala: They gave direct phone number, if someone is scam, why will do they provide direct cell number?
[1/29/25, 6:22:33 PM] ~ Monish: I’m unsure, just asking. Skeptical of any body shop type operators anymore.
[1/29/25, 6:38:14 PM] ~ Johann: Bright Vision is a body shop operator company just like Saras America Inc. They may sponsor your visa, whether it will get approved or not, that’s another story. 

And if you do manage to get a H1B visa or transfer your H1B visa, you’ll probably get a project with a low hourly rate and very basic insurance which you’ll end up paying most of the premiums if not all. 

If you’re desperate then you could consider Bright Vision or any of these body shop companies. Else if you have some self respect, save yourself from these terrible companies to work with. 

I’m not trying to be negative but just speaking from my horrible experience in the US with these companies.

[1/29/25, 10:52:21 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Thanks again, Adi! I connected with an attorney on this (thanks to @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ for that. Circling back on this so others can also benefit. I learned that in such a case where the startup or a third party agent were to petition for your O1, the only way you can work with your full time employer (not the startup) is if you’re a 1099 contractor as opposed to a W2 employee.

[1/30/25, 3:26:35 PM] Sid Sarasvati: FYI - I just added profit sharing to my 401K. I run a plan via Guideline 
Profit sharing allows to max out your 401K contribution up to $69K 

This is also expense for the company so you save taxes on both sides 

It works in my case as I’m the only w2 employee for my business 
Else you can’t can share profit to owners alone. There are strict compliance rules for 401k discrimination
[1/30/25, 3:27:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It’s a nuanced topic that requires a bit of learning the rules.

[1/30/25, 4:49:10 PM] ~ Sam: You could.. but you may need a good attorney to file everything properly.
Buy the business - make sure it has a good revenue stream to pay for your salary

[1/30/25, 5:19:33 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: This is awesome. 

Savings on company tax and lowering tax slab, thereby lower taxes.

Is my understanding correct that as owner one can contribute $69k to 401k and then 23k as Employee 

A Company can pay Employee $46k and Employee can contribute $23k to make $69k (23k is max contribution an Employee can make for 2024)

Good to know that Profit sharing is also available.

Guideline is the provider for 401k plan? ‎<This message was edited>

[1/31/25, 12:26:13 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Hi guys, my passport expires next year and i wanted to ask you guys about the process of getting a new one from the Indian embassy... Has anyone been through this? Do I have to go back to India or the embassy can handle it? Do we have to get  H1B stamped again on the new passport? Any advice is appreciated 🙌🏾
[1/31/25, 12:26:56 PM] ~ ~S~: Just apply through VFS
[1/31/25, 12:27:18 PM] ~ ~S~: No need to travel to India and you don’t need stamping in new passport
[1/31/25, 12:27:38 PM] ~ ~S~: Keep old passport with you when traveling if you have visa stamp in that ‎<This message was edited>
[1/31/25, 12:27:51 PM] ~ Asis Kumar Mandal: U can and should renew it from here itself.. and it's much more smooth 
U don't need the get new stamp of h1b for traveling back anytime.. unless u change job or something lik that needs to reflect.. but carry both passport
[1/31/25, 12:29:33 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Okay thank you! 
Also, can I apply for the new passport at any time? Or do I have to wait till the last 1 year? 
Any idea on how long does it take to get the new passport in general?
[1/31/25, 12:30:59 PM] ~ Asis Kumar Mandal: One year prior expiry... 

If y don't change permanent address it's 2-3 weeks 
.if u change permanent address... Depends upon police verification process time
[1/31/25, 12:31:46 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Okay thank you!
[1/31/25, 12:41:33 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yup all have given same answer 

I can add that I lost my passport in US 
And I got a duplicate made here 

So renewal before expiry is definitely possible and easier 

You only need the H1B Stamp to enter back into US 
So whenever you leave the country you must get the stamp appointment
[1/31/25, 12:49:34 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: So just to confirm: they won't allow me back based on the stamp on my old passport?
[1/31/25, 12:50:03 PM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Even if the stamp is valid and not expired?
[1/31/25, 1:09:30 PM] ~ ~S~: They will. Sid’s case was different.
[1/31/25, 1:58:38 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes correct 
if you have a stamp already that is valid you don’t need a “duplicate” stamp on new passport 

You must carry both passports though :)

[1/31/25, 4:14:20 PM] ~ Linda: Hi guys, I have a question related to the h1b registration process. I’m thinking about registering myself (as opposed to asking a representative to), aka I am the administrator of the uscis account. But since I’m trying to sponsor myself, I am ALSO the beneficiary. So I wonder would the system flag my registration application as invalid and illegible????? Would be great to hear from folks who have used that system before! Thanks
[1/31/25, 4:21:01 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Good question. 
I would say, as it is true in business, even when you are same person, you can represent two different legal entities. 
That said, I had my co-founder sign the official H1B doc as the petitioner and board member. 
Do you have anyone on the board who could sign off on this? Could just make easier.
[1/31/25, 4:38:04 PM] ~ Linda: Okay hearing your experience helps! I will talk to my board members.
[1/31/25, 5:14:55 PM] Sid Sarasvati: All right folks- the discussion last week with Raghavan, the attorney,  was really really good. 
I think he delivered many key insights and answered questions in depth. 
Kudos to those who asked very well structured and key questions. 

The video is now live - https://community.h1bfounders.com/p/breaking-down-the-new-h-1b-founder
[1/31/25, 5:21:32 PM] Sheekha Khetan (H1B Founders): Thank you for sharing!
[2/1/25, 12:46:58 PM] Haluk Gul: Hey guys, I took some notes while listening to the podcast, I'll share them here so others can take a look if they like
[2/1/25, 12:47:11 PM] Haluk Gul: 🎙 *Notes from the Sid x Raghavan Podcast* ✍🏻
- To show you're working part-time, in order to defend your situation and show as evidence, report time sheets + track the records so you can reference them if there's an issue. You can also put "15-25 avg hr / week" to have some wiggle room in case the hours go up or down, so you can point back to it in the case of an evaluation by an officer.
- If you're an F1 or any other visa, you can open up and own a company but can't actively work for it - this doesn't stop you from hiring contractors from other countries. As long as you're not actively involved in it; you can own a company, hire contractors or employees, let them run the business, and you can collect the profits. Be careful to file proper tax returns and accumulate proof that you are not doing the work, others are. 
- For F1 you can do CPT and OPT internships / experience before you go all in on your self funded H1B to build out an portfolio and make use of what you have (what I am planning to do right now)
- Having 3 Board Members is enough - they can be outside of US and a foreign citizen.
- H1B has LCA requirements which means you have to be paid a certain $ industry, position, location's minimum wage.
- In order to be safe - even if you own 90% of the company, you can assign proxy control to your co-founder to show you control less than 50% of the company.
- If you get 100k$ in your company, even if you submitted a 25k$ yearly salary, you can take the profits out if you own the company.
- Even if you're the CEO, it can be more beneficial to be shown as a "software dev" or whatever you're doing to be categorized as a lower level in the SOC (Standard Operational Classification), for which you'll be able to get into a lower salary category to be able to afford your salary easier. You can take out the profits via the company anyway (look at previous point)
- Levels change based on what's required for the role. If B.A. is required and there are basic job requirements, it's Level 1. If it requires a MBA or similar + 2-3 years experience + special skills (can be any of these) then it can rise up to Level 2. 
- Trump Administration has a possibility of being more business friendly in order to drive more investments to US.
[2/1/25, 12:49:07 PM] Haluk Gul: Let me know if you guys think I should add anything else - also a quick suggestion @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩, I can summarize the podcasts as they happen and share notes like these in the group if it’s cool
[2/1/25, 1:20:30 PM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s how we build a community.

If I have a current H1B, I plan to start my own company and file part-time H1B through that company (5 hr a week). This will allow me to be compliant with the salary requirements in the beginning stages till my company makes money.

Say in a year I quit my full-time H1B. Am I allowed to do just the part-time H1B ?

Meaning you would need to get approval again, when you decide to leave the full time job. But I guess with your approach you can work for your company now. Just get a new approval when you decide to leave the full time. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/3/25, 11:18:33 AM] ~ Satya: For the founders who are planning to incorporate your company in Delaware, watch out latest happenings on Delaware , Elon not leaving anyone or any single thing where there is chance of corruption or malpractice ‎<This message was edited>
[2/3/25, 11:20:13 AM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Simplify please 😊 I saw few tweets but didn’t dig much.. what’s the issue with incorporating in Delaware
[2/3/25, 11:21:17 AM] Haluk Gul: Dropbox and Meta are leaving
[2/3/25, 11:24:02 AM] ~ Satya: Elon Musk is currently expressing strong dissatisfaction with Delaware’s corporate governance, particularly following a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that invalidated his substantial Tesla compensation package. In January 2024, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick nullified Musk’s 2018 pay agreement, which was initially valued at $56 billion but has since appreciated significantly due to Tesla’s stock performance. The court determined that the compensation plan was unfair to Tesla shareholders, citing concerns over conflicts of interest and the negotiation process.  ￼

In response to this decision, Musk has been vocal on social media, criticizing the ruling and the judge involved. He has labeled the judgment as “absolute corruption” and described Chancellor McCormick as an “activist judge.” Musk has also advocated for companies to reconsider incorporating in Delaware, suggesting alternatives like Texas or Nevada, which he believes offer better shareholder rights.  ￼

Delaware’s newly inaugurated Governor, Matt Meyer, has acknowledged these concerns and the potential impact on the state’s status as a premier destination for corporate incorporation. He has indicated a willingness to engage with companies contemplating departure and is open to reassessing the state’s corporate laws to ensure they remain competitive and fair.  ￼

This situation highlights a broader debate about corporate governance, executive compensation, and the balance of power between company management and shareholders. The outcome of this dispute could have significant implications for Delaware’s future as a hub for corporate America.
[2/3/25, 11:30:08 AM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: I’m registered in Delaware and making 0$ so don’t think I care much 😊 (for now atleast)
[2/3/25, 11:33:46 AM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: I feel Elon Musk power is unchecked and could be disastrous in the long run.
[2/3/25, 11:50:10 AM] ~ Mark: Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[2/3/25, 11:53:12 AM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Absolutely
[2/3/25, 12:17:01 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: I work on companies' incorporation in my practice (like 100-ish every month). I would 70-90% of the US incorporated entities that I come across are DE. It's just simpler.
[2/3/25, 12:26:01 PM] ~ Satya: I am neither supporting nor opposing Elon on Delaware issue, my intention was to share something happening on Delaware incorporations, that’s all😀
[2/3/25, 12:27:05 PM] ~ Satya: I am clarifying this because otherwise it might end up as a political debate in a business forum ‎<This message was edited>
[2/3/25, 12:27:26 PM] ~ Mark: 🤣
[2/3/25, 12:28:05 PM] ~ Satya: Then Sid will kick me out 😂
[2/3/25, 12:31:51 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: While this discussion is on, can anyone shed light on how is incorporation different from reincorporation in a different state. Is it as simple as closing the business and opening op a new one in a different state? What happens to registered name etc ??
[2/3/25, 12:53:57 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yup I don’t think that’s going away 

Law works on precedence and Delaware has that. Most investors would de risk by going there 

That said, it always good to have completion amongst stats. Maybe Austin can make things better
[2/3/25, 12:55:38 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It will cost you money 
I would say $500-1K - but double check

[2/3/25, 9:11:16 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Experts: Another question 🙋 If I have an LLC which does consulting work and I try to get H1 approval based on the first even SOW my company signs with a client? What happens in following scenarios: 1) I believe I cannot sign the first contract since I am not on h1 so could not sell or sign contracts as a partner. Please confirm. I believe the board members can sign the SOW. 2) After the first contract, I may get another client contract and I might have to travel/work on that client location as well simultaneously? I would definitely have to find an attorney to work out this structure but looking to get opinions or experiences in this scenarios

[2/5/25, 8:11:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: H1B is new job offer and appeals to government to let foreign person work in US 

You (as a candidate) don’t need to have a pre internship 
You can be anywhere ‎<This message was edited>
[2/5/25, 8:23:42 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Can have no association 🙌🏻
[2/5/25, 8:37:42 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Thanks
[2/5/25, 8:49:28 PM] ~ Adi: Hi founders,
I am at my first step of company registration in Delaware. I need some advice based on your ease of experience.
-Legal zoom
-Zen Business 
-Stable
-On the state website 

Second: 
Which website or software do you use to run payroll or bookkeeping?

Also, for part-time H1B purposes, which one would you recommend, LLC or Corporation? (Need some direct feedback from founders) ‎<This message was edited>
[2/5/25, 8:55:56 PM] Sid Sarasvati: For payroll - I recommend gusto 
Easy for small company 
https://gusto.com/r/sid5e6b661d
[2/5/25, 8:56:19 PM] Sid Sarasvati: The referral link will get you some $$
[2/5/25, 8:56:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Back - I cannot recommend mercury enough 
Haven’t had a better bank experience with anything else
[2/5/25, 8:57:57 PM] Sid Sarasvati: For incorporation- I used stripe atlas 
Mostly because that’s my payment processor as well so wanted I wanted to keep it all in one place 
For Delaware it works 

For other states - I recommend you either get a local cpa or do it yourself if you are willing to learn
[2/5/25, 9:03:57 PM] ~ Adi: Great information. Thanks 

Is there any good reference to learn about LLC vs. Corporation? Other than simple Google, i get a zillion  where I can understand in an easy way, instead of complex  language
[2/5/25, 9:04:28 PM] ~ Sahitya: Thanks Sid for this! 
My recommendations
- Stripe ATLAS 
- Mosey for foreign qualification (stripe gives you credits) 
- Bank account - mercury!! 
- Bookkeeping - I've used Wave and Puzzle (both are good), Wave might be cheaper(free version is good) 
- Payroll - experimenting with payroll (we only have 1 employee, prefer to do it ourselves in Excel)
[2/5/25, 9:07:12 PM] ~ Adi: Awesome, thanks..
[2/5/25, 9:08:42 PM] ~ ~S~: Payroll - check Gusto.
[2/5/25, 9:16:52 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Bookkeeping 
I use puzzle (puzzle.io) 
It’s been great. Haven’t used a bookeeper even at 3M ARR 

How is wave?
[2/5/25, 9:29:08 PM] Sid Sarasvati: This just got dropped 
Official timeline 
https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/fy-2026-h-1b-cap-initial-registration-period-opens-on-march-7
[2/5/25, 9:34:52 PM] ~ Sahitya: Wave is good - offers limited features when compared to Puzzle, like bank account integrations are limited. 

It is good for a small pre-revenue/1-2 customer startup in the early stages
[2/5/25, 9:39:29 PM] ~ Dr.Stuti Pardhe: So the registration fee is $215
[2/5/25, 10:19:10 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Opened two companies

A. Doing self research n videos

B. Strioe Atlas / Doola / Legal zoom - I went with Strioe but any service is good.

Any day in my view would be better to use option B. 

Standard documents from
Articles of Incorporation, SS4, Board of Directors, Shares allocation - all these will help in the long run from

Opening bank account to tax filing in future to immigration if one gets RFE, being on the right side of law. 100 fires as one opens business, one less major headache to deal when outsourced.

These services are totally worth it

Payroll - Gusto 

Other areas you might like to plan is
A. Bookkeeping 
B. Tax plan (how the majority of income owner / company keeps)
C. If in Software - Enterprise  Insurance  
I am trying to figure out - started 2nd company recently ‎<This message was edited>

I’ll start one tomorrow 
Would appreciate if all can re-comment there 

Valuable insight and info
[2/5/25, 10:49:02 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: LLC vs C Corp depends upon end goal and profits you are likely to get.

For me, though little more demanding, it. was C Corp. But why you may ask?

Corporation over an LLC for small businesses:
A. Tax Benefits
1. Can deduct employee benefits including health, dental, vision, and prescription benefits
2. Self-employment tax savings as owners are classified as employees
3. Business expenses may be tax-deductible

B. Investment & Capital
1. Easier to raise capital through stock sales
2. More attractive to venture capitalists and investors
3. An unlimited number of shareholders allowed
C. Professional Structure, meaning less chance immigration can poke nose.
D. Protection in case of losses. C Corp is not pass through entity like LLC so Taxation more easier n streamlined ‎<This message was edited>
[2/6/25, 12:10:32 AM] ~ Nahid: The main drawback of a C-corporation is likely double taxation. When the company’s earnings are relatively low, owners can take most or all of it as salary. However, once the company starts generating substantial profits, the IRS may argue that the salary exceeds a reasonable amount and require a portion to be distributed as profits or dividends, which are then taxed twice. Other than that all seems in favor of c-corp.

[2/6/25, 4:11:28 AM] ~ Adi: Thank you all for the information
[2/6/25, 8:05:12 AM] ~ Larem: ‎You removed ~ Larem
[2/6/25, 8:14:38 AM] Sid Sarasvati: C-corp has many more deductions 
Its favorable to investors as it’s the only way to retain money at the lowest tax possible - 21% 
It used to be 37% before 2017 
If you want to reinvest in your business this is the way. 

Everything else flows into your personals income tax and you have take the money out same year and pay tax on it. Which will be higher than 21% 

You can sell c-corp after 5 years and pay no tax on profits - QSBS 
It’s the biggest tax saving strategy

You can draw high salary as a CEO 
A Netflix staff engineers takes $800K base, so your ceiling is high. 
You will be paying payroll taxes on salary + personal income tax ‎<This message was edited>
[2/6/25, 8:16:54 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That said - I suggest everyone  read few books on it 
They are simple and many good ones out there. 
This is not something you can learn quickly from my message above or reading a blog post ‎<This message was edited>
‎[2/6/25, 8:19:32 AM] Sid Sarasvati: ‎image omitted
[2/6/25, 8:32:53 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That said 
My preference for most would be to start an LLC in your state if you are not immediately looking to get venture funds 

LLC can operate as a partnership or c-corp
[2/6/25, 8:34:44 AM] ~ Sam: Another book recommendation for tax strategy:

[2/6/25, 9:14:12 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: True, if you pay dividend. 

But small business, with 1 to 10 employees, why would one pay dividend like big company does?

Small start up

A. Pay 401k of 10-30k, 
B. Healthcare from 1 to 15k 
C. Salary to owner / employee- 80k

X, Y, Z deductibles (check with CPA for what and how much permissable)

This means your company Taxable income goes down from 10k to 50k. 

If company earning 50 to 150k 

How much Taxable income 150 - 80 deductibles - 50 salary so net is 150-130 = 20k 

What tax you owe on 20k
How much can IRS or State tax you on 20k?

Above is just an example 

I was in LLC camp earlier. Thanks to Sid, who mentioned C Corp. 
Thanks to Sid, I did my due diligence and changed my m8nd from LLC to C Corp 
Thanks to Sid, for starting this group place we can discuss brainstorming ideas and his post that brought me to this group 

That said, every situation is different. Do your due diligence what suits your use case ‎<This message was edited>
[2/6/25, 10:04:09 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Awesome. 👏
[2/6/25, 10:52:30 AM] Sid Sarasvati: And don’t forget r&d credits 
It’s free money. For anyone building software any investment you make for r&d - think salary, server cost etc 
That can be claimed as tax credits. You dollars you get back
[2/6/25, 11:01:36 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I’m gonna file mine this year 
As I have profits to show 

Gusto automated it a bit. And they want 15% of all the tax credits they bring you 

So if I get 50K back, they need $15k ‎<This message was edited>
[2/6/25, 11:04:37 AM] ~ Dhruv Parikh: A question that's probably been asked but I wasn't able to find an answer: if I am on the H1B visa working full-time for some company:
1. Am I allowed to have a side hustle from a visa-standpoint?
2. (assuming yes) What is the best entity to setup?
3. Are there any other legal/ regulatory challenges to be aware of?
[2/6/25, 11:08:14 AM] ~ दीपक 🪔: +1
[2/6/25, 11:10:02 AM] ~ दीपक 🪔: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩  Is there a document that you have or links (that can be pinned here) which walks thru basics of how an h1b can navigate his/her way thru visa policy, taxation, etc to  start a business. Thank you 🙂
[2/6/25, 11:11:04 AM] Sid Sarasvati: A single one pager is not possible as there are many decision points and situational cases that demand different routes 
This is why lawyers make money 
It’s like code 
But a complex if else
[2/6/25, 11:11:33 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Better if you share where you stand and what your situation is
[2/6/25, 11:19:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: For basics yes, you can start by watching the first video I did on h1bfounders.com

I can’t decide on one additional board member, can it be a friend or family member? Who writes a board member agreement letter etc, if needed for H1B petition?
[2/6/25, 11:53:24 AM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Also I was talking to a CPA and he suggested getting insurance for all board members
[2/6/25, 11:54:05 AM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Any thoughts?
[2/6/25, 12:17:41 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Alfred since this is fresh in your mind, it would great to do a write up on it. We can post on Substack 
Let me know 
The headline is catchy :)
[2/6/25, 12:19:15 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Never heard of “insurance” for board member before lol 
That’s funny 

You can draft agreement using ChatGPT or find templates online 
Or see if someone on Upwork can do this for you for $50

[2/6/25, 12:33:22 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Must be D&O insurance. Not uncommon. It’s to cover them for any personal liability. May want to have it if they want/insist.
[2/6/25, 12:49:00 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Great, Great!
[2/6/25, 1:05:56 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Yes in case the board member is deceased and he owns equity, that was the explanation given to me
[2/6/25, 1:25:12 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: I mean D&O liability insurance is different. Generally broader and I doubt it covers this. Your scenario should be covered by the governing docs of the company.
[2/6/25, 1:30:56 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Maybe 3 -4 points person about H1B Founder A writes we put a link one and this becomes part of main document 
Person B puts points 3-4  point they write in link two of main document and so on
Multiple perspectives and in one page
I can write 1 document, maybe Alfred you can write one
Together, all links and becomes starting point for someone new in their journey?
[2/6/25, 1:31:52 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes - that will be great. I’ll review it. If you all have substack, you can be co-authors

[2/6/25, 2:47:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You have a quota if you have masters from US 
Otherwise it’s a lottery
[2/6/25, 3:40:33 PM] ~ Nahid: It’s all luck. 65000 for everyone through lottery. An additional 20000 for MS and higher from US through lottery. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/7/25, 5:49:30 PM] ~ Vinit: Hello everyone, I have a question with regards to opening a LLC. Do not want to spam with my messages here, if someone has opened a LLC, I'd like to connect with you directly and get learn more information. 
Appreciate all the help in advance.
[2/7/25, 7:17:59 PM] ~ Anusha Somani: Question!! What’s the absolute last date to be considered for H1b lottery? (Like by when one should have all docs/financials/board ready)
[2/8/25, 11:59:35 AM] ~ Zeeshan Ahmed: Hi guys, I had a conversation with some lawyers about the greencard process. I will leave my notes here for everyone: 

Step 1: PERM application Sponsor company has to create a job description preferably for a role that the employee will take few years down the line. The job description will be posted on websites and Sunday newspaper (this is done to prove the company cannot find talent to fill the role in the US). Employee cannot change companies or else the process starts all over again. 
Total time taken: 16-24 months 
Legal fees: $10k 

Step 2: I-140 
Once PERM is approved employer files I-140 with USCIS. Sponsor must provide proof that employee has all qualifications required and that they are able to pay the market average wages. This step secures the spot in line for greencard priority date. Once I-140 is approved the employee can change companies and start PERM again. But their priority date is secured. H1B can be renewed without any issues. 
Total time taken: 6 months 
Legal fees: $5000 

Step 3: I-485
Once the priority date is near.. employee can file i-485.. for Indians: there is a backlog of 12 years at the moment. Medical exam and interview is conducted 
Time required: backlog of priority dates 
Legal fees: will be decided when the priority date is closer. 

Lawyers mentioned success rate is 100% for green card applicants as long as they meet eligibility criteria.

Step 1 and step 2 are most important. Once those hurdles are passed employees can take a breath of relief. ‎<This message was edited>

[2/8/25, 2:31:34 PM] ~ Divya Saini: Thank you for sharing this! Do you know if priority date on EB3 I-140 be transferred to EB2 or EB1?
[2/8/25, 2:32:00 PM] ~ Adi: Yes, Priority dates can be ported ‎<This message was edited>
[2/8/25, 2:33:42 PM] ~ Divya Saini: Thank you! That’s a relief
[2/8/25, 2:37:20 PM] ~ neel: How is that tho? They both categories are different
[2/8/25, 2:40:39 PM] ~ Adi: Think priority date as your number in line for Green card.
It stays with you if you upgrade from EB3 to EB2 or EB1.
There are other nuances, but it can be ported! 
Please consult a lawyer for all the nuances in upgrading as it is not as easy.
[2/8/25, 2:41:39 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Guys esp @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩  do you know anyone who moved from either  F1/O1/H1B to EB5
[2/8/25, 2:41:57 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Just asking for a friend
[2/8/25, 9:28:32 PM] ~ Himanshu: Hello friend 

My One friend has good experience in IT but lost job. Looking someone for H1 transfer and finding job. 

He is experienced and genuine candidate.

Anyone knows who can transfer his H1 ?
[2/8/25, 9:51:38 PM] ~ Saivrushali: May I know his expertise.
[2/8/25, 9:54:02 PM] ~ Himanshu: I guess - Devops but I forgot
[2/8/25, 9:54:34 PM] ~ Avi: There are quite a few folks who are going EB5 route from H1B. Don't know any of them personally but a few second degree connections and some through random chat groups

[2/8/25, 9:56:50 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: With the way things are in the system protecting yourself and others is very key
[2/8/25, 9:57:00 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Info also is very key
[2/8/25, 9:57:23 PM] ~ Saivrushali: If possible get me a resume 

I am not sure but can ask my employer once
[2/8/25, 9:57:42 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: As for Tax “Franchise Tax” you can resolve that with a Tax Attorney that’s a CPA as I still confirmed today
[2/8/25, 9:58:20 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: The Big guys at times resolve their tax issues every 2-4 years
[2/8/25, 9:58:36 PM] ~ Avi: Though I'd use caution for EB5 route if folks are trying to use the regional centers to fund a business. Some of them are known to go bankrupt and then one might get stuck at a very bad spot - no access to capital for many years, and might get cents on a dollar after litigation and no permanent residence as well. If that's your own business then it's likely less risky

Thanks.
[2/10/25, 4:35:29 PM] ~ Kirti: As long as it routed to your LLC’s account and not your personal account I think you should be alright. 
On F1, if on CPT / OPT with your own company you can then send the agreed upon funds to yourself on w2 / 1099. If not on CPT / OPT you can only work for the university (w2).

[2/11/25, 5:08:50 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Moving to Slack!

Hi everyone,

As our community grows, we need a better way to organize discussions without messages getting lost. Slack allows for topic-based channels, threaded conversations, and structured discussions.

👉 Join our new Slack workspace here: https://join.slack.com/t/h1b-founders/shared_invite/zt-2zmo40ic5-SYS9_d61IoCrBprk2KNH9Q

(Click the link and sign up—it’s free!)

🔹 Why move to Slack?

✅ Easier to follow topic-based discussions (H1B, EB1, legal help, fundraising, etc.).
✅ No more message overload—ask questions in focused channels and get clear answers.
✅ Better collaboration—share resources, discuss immigration cases, and help each other.

🔹 Next Steps:

Join Slack today and introduce yourself in *#introductions 📌.* [it’s been a while you might as well do it again]

Check out key channels like #h1b-visa, #eb1-o1-visa, #legal-help, and #fundraising.

WhatsApp will remain active for few weeks before we fully transition.

Bonus: Early Slack joiners get exclusive access to a private AMA session with me on Feb 20th. Don’t miss out!

[2/12/25, 7:42:44 PM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: Hello Friends, I recently registered a C Corporation in August 2024 with a 50-50% ownership between myself (H1B)and my wife(H4- EAD expired last month). We have also opened a bank account but have not commenced any business activities as of yet.

As we approach tax season, I'm considering understand filing the tax return myself and would like to know:

Is it mandatory to file a tax return for a C Corp that hasn't started any business activities?
Can I file the return myself even if there's been no income or expenses, or should I consider professional help?
If I can do it myself, what forms should I be aware of and what are the best resources or tools to use for a straightforward situation like this?
I appreciate any guidance or tips from those who have gone through similar situations.
Thank you!
[2/12/25, 7:50:43 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Form 1120 for your C Corporation should be files even if no income from Business.
This form is separate from your personal tax.
C Corp is not a pass through entity, unlike LLC, so yes, a separate form 1120 should be filed.
Maybe consult your CPA for filing, or by yourself. Not that difficult
[2/12/25, 7:51:03 PM] ~ Akinsola Adebayo: Good move @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ the ecosystem would interact and support each other well on the Virtual Workspaces there

[2/14/25, 8:25:51 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: For the company website- is it better to use a hosting service or a basic website one can code and host.

For company email, hosting or Google services.

Any suggestions, feedback would appreciate it
[2/14/25, 8:29:03 PM] ~ Mark: Hosting really cheap on GoDaddy...

Google is best for mail, but with your own domain (person@yourdomain.com) but it's like $18 a month...non trivial and gets expensive as you grow, but easy and reliable.

Or (yourcompany@gmail.com) is free but kimda lame...
[2/14/25, 8:32:38 PM] ~ Mark: An AWS Lightsail could do both very inexpensive...but that is pretty heavy technical lifting....I am AWS Certified so I know...but it's like $12 a month but you could mail and web on the same 8nstance....

You may even be able to ChatGPT your way through ut....
[2/14/25, 8:34:27 PM] ~ Mark: A static website on AWS S3 is the absolute cheapest way for web... but only serves static pages...but it could even be less than $4 a month...
[2/14/25, 8:44:54 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Cheapest for static is hostinger and email too, use a cashback website to get extra discounts.

Cloudflare 

Use couldflare pages for static site deployment

[2/15/25, 12:17:42 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Bonus: cicd pipeline for free

[2/15/25, 12:18:50 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Other cloud provider to look for is digital ocean 
We were running $2 / month instances early in the days 
Works well
Much easier than devops complexity that big tech engineers seem to love on aws
[2/15/25, 12:39:08 PM] ~ Eric K.: You can also use GitHub Pages for free hosting for static pages
[2/15/25, 12:46:32 PM] ~ Nik A: Domain service is cheapest in namesilo or cloud flare. Cloud flare just charges the basic icann so.. cheapest. As for hosting it depends on the website. If it's basic website, HTML only there are many including shared server which can be as low as 2-3 a month. If you need website designing, it depends on technology used. There are many WordPress builders which provide hosting but they make site unportable
[2/15/25, 12:49:02 PM] ~ Nik A: If you see using cloud flare for ddos protection, use their SSL certs, free but sometimes can take a bit to get them working
[2/15/25, 3:36:42 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ maybe we can have post company formation as discussion in slack. Maybe helpful who are post company formation phase and discussion on website to tax filing to payroll, just in case, if it does not exist already

I got laid off a month ago on H1B. I am thinking to move to Canada (i have family there and a visitor visa) and search for jobs. I am not inclined to transfer to B1/B2 at this time. 

I wanted to know how does the H1 petition work if I land a job from outside the US?
AFAIK, Since I have a valid H1 stamped until 2027 so the company just needs to apply for I-129 (with premium processing) and I should be able to travel back with the new I797A. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation?
[2/26/25, 2:54:19 PM] ~ Asis Kumar Mandal: H1b stamp would have ur previous employer details.. so that should be updated as well
[2/26/25, 2:57:00 PM] ~ Kanti: Once 60 days timeline ends, your status as H1 is not valid. Your new employer will not be simply applying for transfer of status but new application for H1. You have to travel outside of US and get visa stamped to reinstate your status. Approved H1 is not equal to status reinstating

[3/4/25, 5:18:44 PM] ~ Rishi: Hi Everyone,

We recently incorporated a Manager-Managed LLC in California and need guidance to ensure compliance with US business laws and F1 OPT visa regulations. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

📌 Current Structure:
	•	LLC Type: Manager-Managed
	•	Members (1): F1 OPT holder (passive)
	•	Manager (1): F1 OPT holder (Passive)

We initially understood that F1 OPT holders can start a business but must remain passive. Until now, we have focused on market research for our product. As we prepare to launch on Kickstarter and scale our business, we want to ensure that our structure is legally compliant.

❓ Key Questions:
	1.	Does our current LLC structure comply with US business and immigration laws, considering our visa status?
	2.	Can a member or manager (on F1 OPT) legally sign contracts and agreements, or would that be considered active work?
	3.	We received an EIN and added our manager’s SSN for taxation. Since the manager will need to file taxes at year-end, does this create any legal concerns?
	4.	We opened a business bank account and added the manager’s details. Does this affect compliance?

We have received mixed feedback regarding our structure and want to confirm legal compliance before proceeding further.

🔹 Proposed Changes (If required) (For Compliance & Operational Clarity):
	•	LLC remains Manager-Managed
	•	Manager: US Citizen (with full signatory authority)
	•	Members (2): Both on F1 OPT, remaining passive investors
	•	The US Citizen Manager will not have any ownership/equity
	•	Members will retain 100% equity
	•	An Operating Agreement will document ownership, roles, and financial structure
	•	The Manager (US Citizen) will be the primary account holder for the business bank account

Would this revised structure ensure compliance with immigration and business regulations?

We would greatly appreciate any insights or guidance before making changes.

Thank you for your time and help!

[3/4/25, 9:41:34 PM] ~ Linda: I’m on OPT as well and I’m curious to know the source where it states you must remain passive on your business. My understanding is you can freelance on OPT as you are authorized. As long  as you report on SEVIS about your work

[3/5/25, 1:47:10 PM] ~ Linda: Thinking back the passive term sounds familiar. I think this applies when u are F1 but not actively on CPT or OPT. F1 status allows 20 hrs on campus work only, so if you were to have a business, you can’t work for it. Therefore passively connected

Though, I have got a good CV format, through "simplify.jobs", unfortunately no leads so far.
I am applying via Indeed, LinkedIn, Dice, specially for the companies who have H1B sponsorship record. It is easy in LinkedIn using extension.

Will be grateful for your thoughts on this journey.

[3/8/25, 1:27:35 PM] ~ Siddiquee: Not really, was trying to acheive an offer applying online from home country. 

Second question, no I am not on F1, thus no OPT.
[3/8/25, 1:28:57 PM] ~ Siddiquee: Good point, but I am applying from home country, not in US.
[3/8/25, 3:08:33 PM] ~ Eric K.: Sorry to say it, but that’s extremely unlikely to happen
[3/8/25, 3:09:42 PM] ~ Eric K.: No company will sponsor an H1B for someone who is not already in the US (with some exceptions of course)
[3/8/25, 3:11:41 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: Really is it so?? 😳 I'm also trying to get an offer by applying online.. though I do have a B1/ B2 visa
[3/8/25, 3:11:53 PM] ~ Eric K.: Unless you have an extremely outstanding resume, it will not happen
[3/8/25, 3:12:15 PM] ~ Eric K.: You can apply all you want, but you will not get a single call for interview most likely
[3/8/25, 3:12:23 PM] ~ Eric K.: F1 is the immigration path
[3/8/25, 3:12:38 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: Ahan
[3/8/25, 3:12:56 PM] ~ Eric K.: Applying from home country not, for 99.9% of the people
[3/8/25, 3:13:22 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: So what do you suggest .. either get to the US soil on visit.. then apply for a job?
[3/8/25, 3:15:17 PM] ~ Eric K.: No no
[3/8/25, 3:15:30 PM] ~ Eric K.: That won’t change anything
[3/8/25, 3:15:37 PM] ~ Eric K.: What you need is a work authorization
[3/8/25, 3:15:45 PM] ~ Eric K.: No company is going to hire you if you don’t have one
[3/8/25, 3:15:57 PM] ~ Eric K.: And the route that most people take to get one is F1
[3/8/25, 3:16:16 PM] ~ Eric K.: Because F1 gives you 3 years of work authorization
[3/8/25, 3:16:32 PM] ~ Eric K.: And in those 3 years, once you start working, a company may file an H1B for you
[3/8/25, 3:16:44 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: I understand that.. I was aiming for H1B visa, applying from my home country
[3/8/25, 3:17:35 PM] ~ Eric K.: Unless you have had very high position in companies, or are an outstanding engineer, that won’t happen, sorry
[3/8/25, 3:18:06 PM] ~ Eric K.: I just don’t want you to waste your time applying and applying, because you won’t get to the interview stage of any company most likely
[3/8/25, 3:19:18 PM] ~ Eric K.: If you want send me your resume in private and I can tell you more
[3/8/25, 3:24:13 PM] Haluk Gul: Yea buddy your chances are even 100x less if you're in this position, just level up in your country for now
[3/8/25, 3:30:48 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: Sure I will 😊👍🏻
[3/8/25, 4:38:14 PM] Sid Sarasvati: It’s difficult 
And I wouldn’t say no company 
I guess the biggest difficultly is the lottery 
That’s makes offer to actual joining date a year long process 


But I have a company
And I would go head over heels to sponsor someone who fits the role + extreme talent is rare

[3/8/25, 6:14:08 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: With Tech changing so fast,  experience and GC imp but most imp is trending skills.

US has an extreme shortage of skilled workers and more in trending skills.

Companies will come looking for you once you get those skills.

Also, job market is tight, so time to get job is not surprising. 

In tough times, tough mindset are one who get going. Indeed it is easier said than done but if one puts heart into it, being strong in skills is not difficult either.

[3/8/25, 8:11:56 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: Thanks bro, I've been trying to do so by showcasing myself in a better manner. 
Kindly guide me if you can .. I already have a visit visa and traveled to the US last year. Almost stayed for 5 and a half months. 
My query is .. what if I come back to the US on my visit visa, and find an employer who can adjust my status to H1B.. does this seem possible? ‎<This message was edited>
[3/8/25, 8:25:30 PM] ~ Arun kg: This is no different from applying from the home country. Like everyone pointed above you need to find an employer who can apply H1B for you. It’s getting really difficult these days for ppl here to find a job. So, just set your expectations accordingly.
[3/8/25, 8:28:12 PM] ~ Arun kg: Also if you have an international address, your resume won’t even get past the initial stage. So, try a different path than just applying online. Form connections with ppl who make hiring decision at companies. Unless you have exceptional capabilities it will be difficult to get someone sponsor you when you don’t have work authorization ‎<This message was edited>
[3/8/25, 8:53:20 PM] ~ Shahzad Khan: Ahan got it .. on the lighter side I was thinking, there is such an extreme shortage of workers at every level, but the hiring standards are so high, only avengers can get past the criteria 🤣🤣🤣 just thinking 😁😁🤷🏻🤷🏻
[3/8/25, 9:17:37 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Many folks DM’d on whatsapp 
Reminder to join the Slack community please
Our private channels and topic based discussion will happen there 
here is the link - https://join.slack.com/t/h1b-founders/shared_invite/zt-2zmo40ic5-SYS9_d61IoCrBprk2KNH9Q
It’s free. 

Copying the text from image here as it was hard to read:

"I’m planning to create a private, invite-only #biz-mastermind channel. This space will be exclusively for those who have established a business entity, ensuring that discussions remain focused and operate at the right level of abstraction.

Here’s the initial vision for the group:
- Sharing insights on corporate structures
- Resources and support for current tax year filings
- Discussions on business strategies: HOW TO WIN!

This will be a space for entrepreneurs to connect, support each other, and share their experiences.

The journey of a founder can often feel isolating. Sometimes, all you need is one other person to brainstorm with, and on other days, just a small nudge from someone in the same boat can help reignite your passion.

While there’s no replacement for hard work, a group like this can energize and inspire those on this path. It will be a success if it helps you make better, more informed decisions. I’m excited about the opportunity to learn from all of you!

For starters - PLEASE DM ME if you are interested. "

[3/20/25, 7:31:44 PM] ~ Mark: It's to allow you to participate in the additional 20,000 visas for Masters and Advanced degrees....
[3/20/25, 7:31:59 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Aah thanks
[3/20/25, 7:32:12 PM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: You’re eligible for that.
[3/20/25, 7:32:25 PM] ~ Mark: It will just mean you have a pool available to you of 85,000 H1b's instead of 65,000....

[3/21/25, 8:40:46 AM] ~ Sam: Best case is to open where you are for ease of operating + file expenses if you are using home office. But you can open where ever you want in US as long as you have an address. There are lot of virtual address services for establishing outside of your state. CPA or sites like legal zoom or Bizee do just fine.. make sure all Information is accurate. Single member llc formation is pretty straightforward. Make sure you also get EIN during formation ‎<This message was edited>
[3/21/25, 9:18:06 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Since Columbia is private, nonprofit, accredited foʻr higher institutions, so yes.

But check with your university and each Masters program has a code number, so pl check program code to be doubly sure. ‎<This message was edited>

Hey everyone,

I’ll be traveling to India next week and spending most of my time in Mumbai. If anyone here is in the area, I’d love to connect! We can even plan a small meetup. I’ll be around until the first week of April.

I’m also setting aside time for the h1bfounders community during my trip, separate from my usual work commitments. I’m planning to run two cohorts: one focused on business masterminds and another on EB1A, specifically tailored for people in tech. My goal is to deliver 80% of the value in just 20% of the time, so I’m excited to make this happen. More details will be shared in April. Additionally, we’ll be restarting our monthly calls and podcast-style guest interviews featuring attorneys, founders, and mentors like you.

By the way, how many of you applied for the H1B lottery this month? If you’re feeling unsure about the process, don’t hesitate to DM me—I want to make sure you don't miss on the chance. 

Looking forward to connecting with you all!
[3/21/25, 1:11:39 PM] ~ Eric K.: They go home because they don’t manage to get an offer to stay in the US. Education here is more expensive than anywhere else in the world

There will be Delta, common questions, maybe ask both. You might have multiple perspectives, a legal and Corp viewpoint.

Then cross one viewpoint with another so as to get best of both worlds. I did similar and it helped. Just 2 cents. ‎<This message was edited>

I registered a C Corporation in Delaware and opened a business account with Chase. We haven’t started operations yet—no revenue, no expenses.

Can anyone guide me
 How to file the federal tax return (Form 1120) for an inactive company?
[3/28/25, 11:39:58 AM] Sid Sarasvati: What do you mean by “inactive” company?
[3/28/25, 11:41:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I suggest you hire a cpa from Upwork for $150-200
[3/28/25, 11:42:34 AM] ~ Maniisha: No transactions in the business, where company can be considered to be in its initial stage.
[3/28/25, 11:46:49 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Hope you filed Delaware Franchise Tax, it's also a requirement.

All Delaware corporations must file an Annual Report and pay the Franchise Tax by March 1st of each year, regardless of income or activity.


Federal Tax (Form 1120)
Requirement: All U.S. corporations must file Form 1120 annually, even if they have no income or expenses.

Deadline: Typically due on April 15th.
[3/28/25, 11:47:48 AM] ~ Revanth Gudimalla: Does this apply to remaining states or just Delaware?
[3/28/25, 11:47:53 AM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: Yes I paid for the Franchise Tax.
[3/28/25, 11:49:11 AM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: Yes it is the initial stage.
[3/28/25, 11:50:16 AM] ~ Aadi: I recently started my LLC in Delaware (last week only)

Do i need to pay the franchise tax for now?
[3/28/25, 11:52:10 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: I think yes. But please consult CPA. I know of Delaware for sure. 

If C Corp formed after March 1st, my understanding is the Franchise Tax is due next year. But, please confirm with CPA. ‎<This message was edited>
[3/28/25, 11:54:04 AM] ~ Maniisha: No, you have to pay your Franchise n Annual tax once it completes a year.
[3/28/25, 11:55:13 AM] ~ Maniisha: I also recommend you to call any tax office and enquire which will be free of cost, just to be sure.
[3/29/25, 10:07:14 AM] ~ Mason Manley: When is the latest one could be selected in the H-1B lottery? End of day Sunday, Monday?

[3/31/25, 12:29:44 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: For sure. Two different tracks. H1B ensures one can legally stay in US.

EB2 NIW will only give EB2 category priority date. If that is your goal then goo's. Maybe research further and see goal your are trying to achieve does EB2 NIW helps in that or not
[3/31/25, 12:36:36 AM] Sid Sarasvati: That’s the typical path for most 
Eb2 is employment based green card petition
[3/31/25, 12:43:35 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: If EB1 NIW for H1 EB2 it helps.
 
Trying to see if EB2 NIW would help someone on H1B in EB2 category other than free from bondage PERM every time one changes employer. 

Just putting one view and I could be wrong. Trying to brain storm - more minds better ideas. ‎<This message was edited>

Anyone registered business in Texas?

Just considering benefits of registering in Texas vs Delaware.
[3/31/25, 3:12:18 PM] ~ Nithin Reddy: Technically, it would just be the fact that Delaware has fast track corporate courts for dispute settlement. If you have office/team/confirmed clients in Texas, go for it. But if it's still the early stages of figuring out business, Delaware

[4/6/25, 12:37:43 AM] Sid Sarasvati: As far as i understand, You need  funds in your business bank account 
Which will be US for your US entity 

This is the money the company has liquid 

What is the connection of your foreign/indian bank account with the business?
[4/6/25, 12:47:03 AM] ~ Maniisha: For H-1B approval as a founder or majority stakeholder, funds in an Indian bank account are generally not acceptable as proof of capital for your U.S. business. USCIS typically requires evidence of funds in U.S. based financial institutions, such as bank accounts or stocks, in the company's name. The funds must be liquid and available for business use, and you should provide documentation like bank statements, stock ownership records, and a solid business plan to demonstrate the company's financial viability. It's also advisable to consult an immigration attorney for tailored guidance.
[4/6/25, 12:50:26 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Thanks Manisha, Sid for guidance. So money in US account in form of stocks of Google, Amazon, Tesla etc would work. Sure CPA, Attorney multiple of them will consult as is long term play ‎<This message was edited>
[4/6/25, 12:51:29 AM] ~ Maniisha: If you can present your idea with a well structured proposal and presentation, it can help any one of us to connect you with potential investors through referrals and networking.
[4/6/25, 12:53:37 AM] ~ Maniisha: True, attorneys know all the loopholes. So, it’s better to move your coin from proper attorney.
[4/6/25, 1:06:06 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Not a good guidance unless you can recommend an excellent attorney with personal experience. 

Attorneys and lawyers are good, bad ugly. Most are incompetent in my experience. So you really need to find a good one. 
Just like any profession. 

I wouldn’t have this group if things were as easy as go talk to an attorney. 

My suggestion is to find accountant or attorneys either through rigorous interview or trusted referral. 
Speak with more than one. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/6/25, 1:20:43 AM] ~ Sam: Exactly this. It’s not a straight path to find one great attorney who knows it all. 
I would like to add additional information to Sid’s comment: 
Talk to few attorneys to increase your knowledge and get clarity, and figure out from there. Get ready to spend that $$ for pre screening calls. Attorney time is valuable and costly. Prep your questions properly before going to the call and plan accordingly. Otherwise,  that 30 mins will be over before you know it. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/6/25, 2:27:50 AM] ~ Sandeep Somisetty: Hard agree. I’ve spoken with an immigration attorney twice for twenty minutes each. It was 300 bucks for each call but I made it useful by doing thorough research in advance and having a list of questions and potential follow ups ready. I am an attorney and it’s hard to find a general all purpose attorney in a country like US. Unlike in India, we are very specialized in our practice. And attorneys are expensive (as an extreme example, my firm charges our clients 1200-1300 per hour of my work) but, as individuals, we can’t afford as expensive attorneys. So immigration attorneys or small business attorneys are generally much cheaper but you’ll have to do your research to pin down the right attorney for your specific needs and do your homework and be prepared with good questions.

Any reviews for FirstBase?

Also - if anyone has any experience with setting up a subsidiary (ownership of the US C-Corp should be an Indian Pvt Ltd company), will be glad to connect to learn more.

[4/10/25, 11:18:18 AM] Sid Sarasvati: It’s funny. Scammers are the most creative. Just channeling the energy for the wrong cause. I wish I could tell how much more $$$ they can make if they actually used their brain and creativity in the right direction. Business is pretty much solving such tough problems and getting things done. ‎<This message was edited>

As an entrepreneur back in India and an Entrepreneurship Grad in US. 

I’m curious to know how do you validate your business before launching?

Because I learnt that there are many to validate, want to know what are your ways.

Thanks & Best,

[4/17/25, 10:20:27 PM] ~ @h: For unpaid internships with a startup do we need to have form I9 for the intern. My understanding is no but please confirm
[4/17/25, 10:32:09 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I9 is not filed anywhere 
you must have it as good practice. It serves as a way that you checked the documents of the person. 

With e-verify, it mandated
[4/18/25, 12:20:39 AM] ~ Eric K.: That's incorrect, every employer in the US is required to collect an I-9 from their employees, regardless of e-verify
[4/18/25, 12:21:26 AM] Sid Sarasvati: What is incorrect
[4/18/25, 12:21:30 AM] ~ Eric K.: At any time inspectors could ask a company to provide the I-9 of any employee, and fines can go up to 30k
[4/18/25, 12:21:48 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I said it’s not filed officially like taxes 
You keep it internally ‎<This message was edited>
[4/18/25, 12:21:53 AM] ~ Eric K.: "you must have it as good practice". No. You must have it because it is the law
[4/18/25, 12:22:13 AM] Sid Sarasvati: For unpaid intern?
[4/18/25, 12:22:51 AM] ~ Eric K.: I-9 is required for employees. If an unpaid intern is not an employee, then they don't need to fill an I-9
[4/18/25, 12:23:26 AM] Sid Sarasvati: How do you define an employee?
[4/18/25, 12:24:27 AM] ~ Eric K.: W-2
[4/18/25, 12:27:21 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Ok yes 
If you use gusto and other hr system which you just 
They help with i9 and w2 and w8 (for foreign) automatically or make it easier 

I was answering his question about unpaid intent 
Still a good practice to do i9 

I did I9 for my contract hire employee - they were on opt. So not only w2
[4/18/25, 12:28:34 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Btw those wondering i9 is a one page pdf 
You fill it 
Pass it to your employee they fill it and sign it
[4/18/25, 12:28:39 AM] Sid Sarasvati: You put the date yourself
[4/18/25, 12:30:51 AM] Sid Sarasvati: There is no website or official submission that tracks dates or time or anything 
So you have to manage it 

The law is that you just check documents etc 
It’s trivial

[4/19/25, 9:06:53 AM] ~ Nadeem Khasim: Hi All, for those of you who are running a business currently, what company structure did you end up choosing? Delaware c corp vs LLC vs S corp etc? 

I’m very close to signing my first client for my consulting business and my company currently is a Georgia LLC. Not sure if thats the best option for tax plus h1b compliance reasons
[4/19/25, 10:15:48 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: State of company formation does not matter. Delware or Nevada are good as they have business friendlier. State tax could be advantage if State has no State tax, that is, which state business operations.

C corp are better in eyes of USCIS since looks to them proper business company, not to say LLC are not. But immigration officers are less educated in terms of business formation and so C Corp I preferred.
That said above just my 2 cents. Attorney and CPA you can seek guidance as having and running business is big long term time consuming activity. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/21/25, 12:06:16 PM] ~ Falaknaaz: But all the best
[4/21/25, 12:06:45 PM] ~ Manish: Yes I have never heard it being approved
[4/21/25, 12:07:07 PM] ~ Manish: I only hear people using it to buy time past 60-day grace period of h1b
[4/21/25, 12:24:29 PM] ~ Kishan: You can move to b1/b2 for 6 months and when you want to come back h1 it’s the same process - file the COS b1 to h1 that’s all but not sure what you mean by 1 month
[4/21/25, 12:25:13 PM] ~ Falaknaaz: Any idea how much time this takes ?
[4/21/25, 12:25:27 PM] ~ Kishan: Premium less than a week
[4/21/25, 12:25:32 PM] ~ Manish: There is concept of converting one visa to another. We can only change statuses
[4/21/25, 12:25:35 PM] ~ Falaknaaz: Got it
[4/21/25, 12:25:50 PM] ~ Falaknaaz: Thank you
[4/21/25, 12:25:51 PM] ~ Manish: I539 has premium now?
[4/21/25, 1:02:20 PM] ~ Ravi: If you are returning to your home country (and intend to visit US for a month next year), then you have to simply apply for a B1/B2 visa in your home country. Change of status from H1B to B2 is valid approach only to continue your current stay in US (You get an updated status and I94. It  doesn't give you a B2 visa for next year's  intended visit back into US).
[4/21/25, 1:33:14 PM] ~ Manish: This ^

If you return to your country, use consular processing to get B1/B1 visa. Takes a week for visa to be issued after passport is accepted. This isn’t premium, this is dropbox.
[4/21/25, 1:34:44 PM] ~ Manish: H1B -> B1/B2 might need interview if changing visa classes
[4/21/25, 1:34:52 PM] ~ Manish: do you know if anyone managed to get H1B -> B1/B2 using premium change of status while inside US? Only F, J and M have premium processing for change of status https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-expands-premium-processing-for-applicants-seeking-to-change-into-f-m-or-j-nonimmigrant-status
[4/21/25, 1:37:12 PM] ~ Mark: The interesting thing about that is that you still have status under your H1b as there is no premium for H1b to B1/B2...so good for as long as it takes.....
[4/21/25, 1:48:39 PM] ~ Ravi: You are allowed to stay in US on receipt notice of the change of status application.  Your H1B status likely doesn't continue and you can't work.
[4/21/25, 2:04:01 PM] ~ Mark: 👍
[4/21/25, 2:04:19 PM] ~ Mark: You are still on H1b until B1/B2 decision.
[4/21/25, 2:26:06 PM] ~ Manish: yes, but can’t work from what I know.
[4/21/25, 2:38:33 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: If your F1 is expiring can you ask for change of status to B1/B2 while still in the country ?
[4/21/25, 3:13:41 PM] ~ Mark: Yep....
[4/21/25, 3:13:45 PM] ~ Mark: Done all the time...
[4/21/25, 3:13:59 PM] ~ Mark: Can't work.
[4/21/25, 3:26:24 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: And usually how long is that B1 B2 valid for ?
[4/21/25, 3:52:12 PM] ~ Mark: 6 months...
[4/21/25, 3:55:11 PM] ~ Ritika Patni: Can you travel in and out on it ?
[4/21/25, 3:56:55 PM] ~ Manish: no. you cannot. when you apply for change of status via USCIS form and then leave the country, that petition is abandoned
[4/21/25, 3:57:01 PM] ~ Manish: you’ll have to apply for B1/B2 consular processing if you leave the country

Once you are picked in lottery, then you provide your information to the lawyers assigned by your company.

Your lawyers have to file the paperwork by June 30th.

Your company agreeing to register your name for the lottery or provide the lawyer contact info for you to register should act as the de facto company approval

Turkey is not America. Its can’t be. And the fact that you are here  taking jobs aways from well qualified American citizens is also a threat. It just depends how I define my national security. Policies are not made on such broad - catch em the way I want - language. 

Authoritarianism runs deep most of non western new democracies. Be it Turkey or India. And it shows. 

I agree that US must maintain its roots and culture of what makes it awesome. But not by acting exactly like third world ‎<This message was edited>
[4/29/25, 11:11:48 AM] Sid Sarasvati: I think use of such language by USCIS is unprecedented. 

Social media is always monitored. I don’t think that’s news to Americans. I mean even during Obama we have phone recordings being monitored as what the Edward Snowden revealed. 

What’s new now is the glaring optics of this and the overall circumvention of due process. 

And keeping people in this “strategic uncertainty” lol 

So let’s see. I think USCIS can serve America better by stopping scam businesses, fake immigration and really help skill based competence and attract them towards America. That serves America best vs scaring and threatening. Americans superpower is that it attracts the best of minds
[4/29/25, 11:20:19 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Open to another perspective btw 
I don’t think in these matters there is one right answer. It’s a question of policy. And policies have side effects. 

But anyone who speaks let’s keep this conversation to the point and not throw in political talking points or get overly personal.
[4/29/25, 11:27:29 AM] Haluk Gul: I agree on going over scam businesses + fake immigration + prioritizing value producing immigrants
[4/29/25, 11:28:01 AM] Sid Sarasvati: How many of you will refrain on commenting or think before saying too much because of USCIS? 

That’s exactly what’s makes this statement by USCIS so damning
[4/29/25, 11:28:38 AM] Haluk Gul: America needs the value producing immigrants to keep the system running anyways so doubt they’ll push too hard
[4/29/25, 11:30:45 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Indeed, it is unprecedented.

Under Democratic regime things were one extreme, open borders, including criminals. 

Under Trump it is another extreme.

Maybe it's a matter of 1 year and dust will settle like many students their I 20 were terminated and then reinstated.

GC were turned back and now returning to normalcy.

If you see same is happening in Europe. But extreme stance does not stand long. Like Democrat lost big time due to policies, other extreme measure will go too. Time is a big teacher. ‎<This message was edited>

[4/29/25, 6:32:49 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “Busted & booted -These criminals thought they could outrun the law—until they were finally caught in March with the assistance from USCIS.” 

lol - 😂 - it’s like they trained the social media manager LLM on Trumps speeches 
https://x.com/uscis/status/1914665525445001231?s=46
[4/29/25, 6:40:24 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Anyway - decency from government agencies was what separated America and most of developed world from the developing ones
But this is setting the standards too low. 

It’s almost Indistinguishable from parody at times.  

I think most moderates who moved right are slowly realizing how the right wing extreme is far worse than left woke mobs 
The left cancelled you - the right sends you to prison in foreign lands
[4/29/25, 6:43:10 PM] ~ Shobhit G: Sounds too harsh …Left wants your kids change their gender without your say ..they take money from Earners and give to Burners .. If a country is enforcing the law they have ..I doubt wonder what’s wrong in there?
[4/29/25, 6:50:38 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I’m not a fan of left fringe or left or whatever. 
But to say left wants your kids to change gender is like saying all right wingers are nazi 
It’s too broad a stoke for social dynamic are are way nuances 

Any ideology at the fringe turns authoritarian. So left and right both turn equally fascist - my way or highway 
It’s the authoritarian instinct that the American constitution fights well with checks and balances 

So what I saying is left wing authoritarianism leads to canceling and virtual signalling and whatever happened at peak woke era. 
Now that tide has turned. We get see first hand the tyranny under bay of the right fringe gets more power. 

It will be more apparent in few years. 
I remain optimistic though.
[4/29/25, 6:51:32 PM] Sid Sarasvati: This is a good book btw on American socio politics cycles 
Highly recommend

As of now only planning to hire and pay offshore resources and if any profits keep them in company account and not pay self, if that makes sense
[4/30/25, 3:35:10 PM] ~ Tanmay: If you are on H1B and you open a LLC, in my knowledge you have to pay yourself a salary. Do double check with a lawyer ‎<This message was edited>
[4/30/25, 3:37:26 PM] ~ Yash: So I'm not opening the LLC to sponsor the H1 yet, will still be working thru my main job, this will be side until becomes main and able to sponsor
[4/30/25, 3:40:50 PM] ~ Amir Siddiki: If you are not sponsoring H1B from your own LLC then you are fine you can have 49% max equity owner and you should not be running day to day operations you will be Founder and board Member.
My Lawyer advised me to open in partnership .. For sole ownership I’m not sure

[4/30/25, 8:33:34 PM] ~ Preety: Creating an S-Corp vs C-Corp? Which one is better if you are working on H1b.
[4/30/25, 8:34:56 PM] ~ Tanmay: Do C if you wanna raise
[4/30/25, 8:35:17 PM] ~ Preety: Say more please
[4/30/25, 8:38:16 PM] ~ Tanmay: Delaware C corp is recommended by YC and many other vc funds if you would wanna raise. This allows a variety of stock classes. 

If you are bootstrapping and have decent funds in the company choose S corp and pay yourself a decent salary so the company can count that as an expense and you will get a W-2 . Limited by restrictions on the number of shareholders and can issue only one class of stock.
[4/30/25, 8:43:30 PM] ~ Preety: This is helpful thanks!
[4/30/25, 8:50:40 PM] ~ Shobhit G: Can non residents form an S corp?
[4/30/25, 8:50:54 PM] ~ Ameen: Nope.
[4/30/25, 8:52:43 PM] ~ Shobhit G: That’s what I thought. I am about to register a C Corp .. prefer that over LLC for flexibility of funds distribution .. llc will trigger the tax the minute it reaches the account
[4/30/25, 8:54:54 PM] ~ Shobhit G: On the other hand, C Corp will pay 30% corporate taxes if money kept there.. but if I disburse everything… will be same as llc .. flexibility to wiggle later and better protection. 

Slightly high registration cost but similar maintenance costs ..
[4/30/25, 11:51:00 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: C corp flat 21% rate was established by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and has been in effect since January 1, 2018

[5/1/25, 7:50:25 AM] ~ ~S~: Lawyer might help in reviewing the agreements but will not help you in determine the right entity. It is your business and you know the plan of what you want to do and at what stage. Based on this you should talk to your tax consultant and evaluate pros and cons. ‎<This message was edited>
[5/1/25, 8:14:17 AM] ~ Vineet Gavri: This is a topic of interest to me as well, while I have been running a LLC since a year and it is not that straight forward.. I would love to share what I have learnt and learn more , but there are 3 different folks involved - none of them generally has a complete picture : 
1. CPA would advise on the Tax and compliance related situation 
2. Corp lawyer would be needed to navigate the nuances of for foreign entity, bylaws etc. 
3. Immigration lawyer would guide on the immigration aspects 
And if you ask any one of them they would tell you they only know their aspect of things. Its actually daunting to understand and make the right decision. We should have a call for those interested and people who have done this for a bit to share experiences.

What is it that you want? Narrow it down. 
Am I asking the right question? Can I frame and communicate with intent? 
Why would anyone care to respond to me? 

Right now - you are not even punctuating your questions
And spurted 5 messages as a thought vomit instead of a cohesive narrative that shows effort and would incline people to engage. 
Same goes with investors. 

As far a searching / reaching - many investor hosts events for free. Easy to find if you are one of the major cities 
Go join hackathon or similar events

So, Next insurance with Gusto!! Is it available for founders in Software related Startups? Was it better cost wise like Hartford insurance?

Regarding website one, we can get via $8 via Northwest no maintenance or server headache, justin case.. Someone like me as job, then prep work for startup ‎<This message was edited>

[6/26/25, 2:48:07 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hey everyone, hope you're all doing well as summer kicks in.


Wanted to share a few updates and ideas I’ve been thinking about for our community:


1, I’d like to get us back on a regular monthly call schedule. I managed to keep this going throughout 2024, but this year’s been a bit hectic. Time to fix that. Planning to set up a schedule for the rest of the year using our h1bfounders lu.ma account (https://lu.ma/h1b). If anyone wants to lend a hand with this, feel free to DM me.


2. My last podcast with Raghavan N from Serotte Law got a great response—seemed like a lot of you found it valuable. So, I’m bringing Raghavan back for a summer session. For those who might not know, Raghavan was instrumental in helping me transition to being a founder on an H1B with my company. Some of you may have already connected with him here as well.


3. I’m excited to host our first in-person H1B Founders meetup in Boston, ideally toward the end of July. A few folks in and around Massachusetts have already expressed interest. I’ll share more details soon, but if you’re in the area or can make it to Boston for a half-day event focused on learning and sharing, shoot me a DM—I’ll start putting a list together.


Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on other things we can work on together. This community is filled with incredible people, each with a unique story and perspective on what it takes to succeed as immigrants in the U.S. Let’s continue to celebrate and support each other—we’ve come a long way, and there’s so much more we can do. ‎<This message was edited>

I developed an App where immigrants can store all their immigration docs in a secure folder on your phone. This makes them all easily presented to law enforcement or ICE when stopped.

There is a lot of fear out there with this current administration.

I have my Green Card now, so I wanted to help others.

Is it appropriate for me to post a link here?

No worries if no interest.

[6/28/25, 7:56:45 PM] ~ Manish: this can be quite useful if you can show the documents without unlocking the phone
[6/28/25, 7:56:59 PM] ~ Manish: like how you can do for flight boarding pass using Apple Wallet
[6/28/25, 7:59:19 PM] ~ Mark: Well, good point, but this is secure storage that even if someone stole your phone you are protected with Biometric and if you choose a PIN.
[6/28/25, 8:00:05 PM] ~ Mark: I was also thinking of adding a screen lock so if you handed the phone to the cops or Ice, all they could do is view your docs....
[6/28/25, 8:02:11 PM] ~ Manish: and choose a PIN, not biometrics
[6/28/25, 8:02:11 PM] ~ Manish: https://esslawpartners.com/can-police-officers-force-you-to-unlock-your-cell-phone-what-does-the-fifth-amendment-say/
[6/28/25, 8:02:19 PM] ~ Manish: ```
As per current law, the police have the authority to demand unlocking if your phone has facial recognition or fingerprint identification set. However, they cannot do so if you choose a pattern lock or a passcode/password.

The reason is clear: unlocking with a passcode implies knowledge of that code, constituting a testimonial act protected by the Fifth Amendment. In contrast, using facial recognition or fingerprints is considered a nontestimonial act, revealing no explicit knowledge.
```
[6/28/25, 8:03:22 PM] ~ Mark: I did not know this....good to know...

[6/28/25, 8:13:10 PM] Haluk Gul: They could spin up something and find loopholes to get the data anyway - just sayin..
[6/28/25, 8:15:16 PM] ~ Mark: If I have committed a crime, so be it.It's the Nazi attitude to innocent people I object to.
[6/28/25, 8:17:36 PM] Haluk Gul: No I do see where you’re coming from - just consider these things if you’re gonna seriously spend time and energy on developing something - better to be angry and realistic than happy and unsuspecting
[6/28/25, 8:22:03 PM] ~ Manish: its still important to put up roadblocks to easy access of your personal information. you are also counting on making it clear that you dont allow this in some slim hope that if it goes to trial, you have something to lean against. its said many trial lawyers make sure to object and be on record to create a case for appeal if the hearing goes in the opposite direction

[7/2/25, 3:29:32 PM] Sid Sarasvati: H1BFounders is leveling up!


Thrilled to share some exciting news—Manisha Poppula [@⁨~Maniisha⁩] a recent 'Entrepreneurship' graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology (also my alma mater!) and a budding entrepreneur, will be stepping in to help elevate the H1BFounders community.


Our goal is to take things to the next stage by providing even greater support—whether it's advice, mentorship, legal and financial guidance, or investor connections. We’ve got plenty of ideas to explore, but to start, we’ll focus on refreshing our Slack workspace, hosting meetups, kicking off monthly calls, and bringing in guest speakers. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/2/25, 3:40:19 PM] ~ Maniisha: Thank you for the opportunity Sid. This is an exciting collaboration, and my vision deeply aligns with Sid’s mission for H1BFounders creating a unified platform where immigrant founders can connect with resources, investors, and each other. Sid has built an incredible community, and I’m thrilled to contribute toward our shared goal to support immigrant entrepreneurs. Looking forward to create more value for all our members.
[7/2/25, 4:04:21 PM] ~ Rish: Has anyone used tools like lovable / bolt / Replit / Cursor to create their web apps and launched it? Any particular one which is good? Trying to to see how scalable has it been for you. I am not a coder so wanted to know how much success has anyone got from launching apps created through these tools.
[7/2/25, 4:09:41 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Yes
[7/2/25, 4:09:47 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: I built with Bolt.
[7/2/25, 4:10:09 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: I’m willing to share few things I have built using it and how I do it.
[7/2/25, 4:12:00 PM] ~ Ameen: Yes. I am using lovable and it’s been great. I have a functional website, but still in the process of hosting it.
[7/2/25, 4:22:50 PM] ~ Aadi: I built my whole website and mobile application using cursor and its good although you would need little programming knowledge to debug or for modifications when using cursor 
But with minimal coding experience you can build amazing web app

you can have a look on this one for UI

https://www.alfamodo.com
[7/2/25, 4:43:34 PM] ~ Anusha Somani: I've used lovable for my MVP
[7/2/25, 4:46:49 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: After Coding website are you hosting maybe GCP or AWS or similar. 
How much does it cost for hosting? Or 9$ end to end on WordPress. Which would be easier from time crunch perspective. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/2/25, 4:50:51 PM] ~ Rish: Thanks guys. I am also using lovable and intitialy had a good start but I noticed later it breaks one thing while building another thing. Does anyone have a prompt cheat sheet which they can share?
[7/2/25, 4:51:38 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Pretty nice website 👌
[7/2/25, 4:52:13 PM] ~ Rish: Looks great. Is your mobile app also live?
[7/2/25, 4:54:07 PM] ~ Phill: Wow... that amazing. I would like to take a look at the mobile app too..
[7/2/25, 4:55:24 PM] ~ Mark: I encourage people to look at Flutter for mobile....almost zero code change flipping from Android to iOS.
[7/2/25, 4:55:43 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Creatorequity.xyz
[7/2/25, 4:55:52 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: I built that as MVP
[7/2/25, 4:56:53 PM] ~ Mark: Most of the AI tools can generate and correct Flitter.
[7/2/25, 4:56:58 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: You could try both mobile and web version for feedback- appreciate.
[7/2/25, 4:58:19 PM] ~ Rish: Were you guys able to do stripe integration easily into your lovable app?
[7/2/25, 4:59:33 PM] ~ Anusha Somani: Same question. Does cursor let you integrate stripe easily?
[7/2/25, 5:00:57 PM] ~ Mark: Just an FYI - there is a Stripe Flutter SDK that makes Stripe integration less of a lift.
[7/2/25, 5:01:20 PM] ~ Mark: Yeah Cursor would for sure help.
[7/2/25, 5:14:21 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I advice against it 
Mark - talk to me if you want to share notes 

Use react native if you want a hybrid framework for iOS/Android 

Also easy to transfer/hire typescript and react skills

[7/2/25, 11:48:25 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Does filing a concurrent H1B easier than a H1B transfer ? Are there any specific con of one over other?
[7/2/25, 11:50:30 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Also for all successful filers, does having a physical office address like a we work considered best practice? My attorney told me to get one in case of uscis visits.
[7/2/25, 11:51:31 PM] ~ Tanmay: These are such good questions !
[7/2/25, 11:53:08 PM] ~ Abhishek Wahane: I’ve been advised by few lawyers to have separate physical office space, at least a suite room 
Wework and coworking cause issues with LCA
[7/2/25, 11:54:34 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Hmmm….🤔 that’s a lot of cost for a bootstrapped business
[7/2/25, 11:56:45 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: I wonder what others are doing after approvals? Do we have to use the space everyday in some way ? Or we file a hybrid LCA
[7/2/25, 11:57:23 PM] ~ Tanmay: If you are paying yourself 85k/year(lower end) on h1b 

The company will have to
Pay roughly 5-6k in corp taxes
Health insurance 2-3k per year
Personal taxes will be 13-15k 
Then office rent would be $5-8K  a year

Out of pocket yearly cost is almost 30K for boostrapped business on H1B

Disclaimer - These are my personal calculations , would differ case by case basis ‎<This message was edited>
[7/2/25, 11:59:00 PM] ~ Kishan: you are on a h1b already?
[7/2/25, 11:59:09 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Yes

[7/3/25, 12:01:13 AM] ~ Tanmay: Is concurrent cheaper to file than transfer ?

P.S. - I am currently on H1B as well ‎<This message was edited>

[7/3/25, 12:03:29 AM] ~ Kishan: 6 to 8k out off pocket unless you want file yourself without the need of a lawyer
[7/3/25, 12:03:51 AM] ~ Tanmay: Ahh so for concurrent you could show part time so paying yourself would be less
[7/3/25, 12:03:59 AM] ~ Kishan: correct
[7/3/25, 12:07:01 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Not really 
It’s advisable if you can 
But home office worked in my case 
Many businesses have started in a garage. It’s not illegal unless your building prohibits any home office or commercial stuff. Rare

Few Thoughts trying to share another perspective 

If C Corp then you don't owe Personal taxes. Once profitable C Corp will be 13-15k 

C Corp vs Individual two different entities

Health insurance C Corp pays, reducing your taxable income

C Corp tax one pays when business is profitable.

Disclaimer: I am in process to form, don't own company as yet. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/4/25, 12:33:35 PM] ~ Tanmay: If the C Corp pays you a salary which it has to for H1B wont you still owe personal taxes regardless if its profitable or not, also payroll taxes C corp will have to pay. I could be missing something ‎<This message was edited>
[7/4/25, 1:40:52 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Yes true.
One can mitigate these taxes to an extent by paying IRA both as Employee and as Employer.

Example Salary 100k. Pay IRA as Employee 20k, Employer 20k. These one can go while running payroll in Gusto or similar.

Thereby Net taxableble income as Employee and Employer goes down

Corp taxes reduce by Legal fees, company formation fees, Insurance fee, Healthcare etc
Sharing what I discussed with CPA. Google backdoor IRA. Limit 60k plus what I remember.

Only drawback from liquid funds, money gets transferred to Retirement funds. But better than going out of pocket.

That said every situation is different so do your due diligence and have good documentation, best remedy is Documentation even if IRS questions one. ‎<This message was edited>

🚨 Live Immigration Q&A – July 10 @ 8 PM ET

Join us for a live session with Raghavan Nagarajan (Serotte Law) to discuss U.S. immigration pathways, including visas, green cards, and the latest policy updates.

🗓️ Thursday, July 10
🕗 8:00 PM ET | 5:00 PM PT
🎙️ Hosted by Sid Sarasvati

Get practical answers, legal insights, and a chance to ask your questions live.

I know firsthand how complex U.S. immigration law can be, especially with international founders. That’s why I’m excited for this session. Raghavan brought deep expertise and practical clarity from his previous podcast with Sid and I truly believe the coming conversation will offer a roadmap for navigating both the rules and strategies.

[7/12/25, 6:36:27 PM] ~ 😀: Hi All, 

My best friend looking for immigration guidance and lawyer to file 140 EAD under compelling circumstances. 

Please guide or provide lawyer contacts if anyone has experienced filing this.
[7/12/25, 9:02:26 PM] ~ Sanjay: This might a be difficult one. Especially in the current political climate. I remember some lawyer sharing stats that only 67 of these petitions have been approved since they began. And there is no premium processing option for it.
[7/12/25, 9:04:11 PM] ~ Sanjay: If you’d like a consult I’d them to connect with Steven brown from Reddy, Nuemann & Brown. I’ve worked with him and he’s been great. You can email him on steven@rnlawgroup.com, let him know you got his contact from sanjay.
[7/12/25, 9:05:53 PM] ~ Mark: I concur- REDDY & Numann are top notch.
[7/12/25, 9:39:21 PM] ~ Ros: What are strategies people are using to reduce the burden of paying yourself? For folk just starting off (like me) and are self funding, it's an extra tax penalty

- one I've heard so far is maxing out contributions to 401k ($69k)

Any other strategies?
[7/12/25, 10:15:29 PM] ~ Tanmay: For H1B LCA office address is mandatory , Does home address or we work address work or do we actually need to rent an office ?
[7/12/25, 10:15:59 PM] ~ Ros: I'm using home office - lawyers have said it's ok
[7/14/25, 11:59:38 AM] ~ Nik A: Hello, just for information collecting at this time - if starting a new llc, can I apply for concurrent H1B under that before I eventually end the previous h1b? Especially if I am showing different work days or what are requirements of concurrent H1B. Thank you
[7/14/25, 3:49:11 PM] Sid Sarasvati: 2.5 years into Renovate AI

it works like clockwork; very interesting 
you revenue data (if it goes up and down) might not make any sense unless you can account for it for your market. in fact, it will give you anxiety as if something is wrong with the business.

Has anyone here successfully run a crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter (or a similar platform)? We're currently in the prelaunch phase—building our email list and engaging potential backers—and would deeply appreciate any strategies or insights you might have.
Whether it's tactics for maximizing visibility, driving early momentum, or nurturing a strong supporter base, we'd love to hear what’s worked for you. This project means a lot to us, and your guidance could make a real difference.
Thanks so much in advance!

Immigration to the USA (Discontinued)

🤣🤣🤣
[7/17/25, 6:00:48 PM] Haluk Gul: USA always wants and needs top tier people that's why they have things like E-2 and O1 visa
[7/17/25, 6:01:03 PM] Haluk Gul: I'd say more like illegal immigration + low skill / low talent immigration
[7/17/25, 6:01:31 PM] Haluk Gul: don't think you'll have much trouble being a top AI researcher from any country in the world :)

Is anything serious ? 🧐

[7/17/25, 6:29:48 PM] ~ Rish: Where is this coming from? Did you hear anything from USCIS?
[7/17/25, 6:31:56 PM] ~ LOTUS: Heard From a podcast lawyers in YouTube that there is lot more heavy scrutiny regarding extra ordinary capabilities
[7/17/25, 6:32:44 PM] ~ Tanmay: For O1 as well ?
[7/17/25, 6:32:56 PM] ~ LOTUS: Need some help on filing EB1 now. Pls advice any good first steps on it
[7/17/25, 6:33:32 PM] ~ LOTUS: Haven't heard abt O1...not sure
[7/17/25, 6:33:32 PM] ~ Rish: Heavy scrutiny might be true as there is more influx of applicants but that doesn’t mean self sponsored EB1A is not available!! Most of the people do self sponsored EB1A only.
[7/17/25, 6:33:52 PM] ~ Rish: Talk to 2-3 lawyers once you feel that you are somewhat ready
[7/17/25, 6:36:38 PM] ~ LOTUS: It's all abt the too much of scrutiny which wasn't case last few years

Due to this huge increase in scrutiny and too much of increased level of achievements, lots of ppl who would have got before will not be even considered.

Huge difference i m hearing on level of ppl its available for even though its available to apply.
[7/17/25, 6:38:27 PM] ~ LOTUS: As i m hearing too tough now a days from couple lawyers itself, checking here if anyone gone thru recently so they can give me first hand real time experience in current 2025 Mid situations

They do free 15 minute consultation as well
[7/18/25, 12:41:02 AM] ~ Avi: Inventimm and Alcorn come to my mind. And I think you'd need to negotiate a timeline after you choose your lawyer to seek an agreement about by when they can file it

Please feel free to DM me—thank you so much! 🙏

[7/18/25, 7:22:21 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Since it is company account you might also wanted to document in Company meeting minutes as proof when you like Company Taxes. If LLC on email Discussion and outcome that is Loan to Company. Helps at time year end Tax filings. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/18/25, 10:23:27 PM] ~ Ros: I documented it with a capital contributions form (personal funds into LLC bank account)
[7/18/25, 10:28:34 PM] ~ Ros: Consulted with a tax professional as well
[7/18/25, 11:41:15 PM] Sid Sarasvati: you dont’ need meeting minutes 
Just proper account categorization in the books 
And a loan document for sure with terms and interest etc. Chatgpt can create one easy. 
I took my money out after 1 year with interest 🙂
[7/18/25, 11:57:59 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Depends if its LLC or C Corp. If C Corp then it is good idea to have in meeting minutes.

Meeting minutes are generally required for C corporations when making capital contributions. C corporations face more state-imposed record requirements than other business entities:

Annual meetings must be held and documented with formal minutes

Board resolutions should approve major financial decisions, including capital contributions

Meeting minutes can document transactions with tax significance, including owner capital contributions.

That said, Tax, Law are interpretations, some CPAs view A way, some B.

Mine is Delware C Corp so I choose to document. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/19/25, 12:10:40 AM] Sid Sarasvati: what is this meeting you are referring to? is this a board meeting you want to document to approve the incoming loan? 
I think it’s a good idea 
but meeting notes is not a substitute for actual loan agreement 
If you tax audited, you must show the business paid proper interest on the loan and that it was all documented
[7/19/25, 12:11:53 AM] Sid Sarasvati: and obviously proper categorization of the loan in the books as ‘shareholder loan’ which will be a liability
[7/19/25, 12:13:21 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: Loan Agreement is must with terms. And, yes, Board meeting.

[7/19/25, 12:17:18 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Ok. That’s corporate governance 
I assume if you had a real board and piped money in as loan you board might not like it - depends on the bylaws 
It’s better not to confuse IRS and accounting to corporate governance 

Most LLC and now even h1bfounders would not even need a board with the new h1b founder rule.

[7/19/25, 12:28:14 AM] ~ Kartik Mehta: We have Trump in office. So though Board is no longer requirement.as per Jan 2025 Memo, I got Board members, just in case changes happen.
[7/19/25, 12:15:49 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Well that’s good 
I think am compelled to answer it again since the purpose of my effort and this group here is exactly counter this paranoia 

Such idea leads back to forums and discussion every read and got paralyzed 

I suggest you do what serves you best 
But it’s not a good advice for others who already stuck with 99 problems. 
US is not perfect but doesn’t work like Indian bureaucracies 
You don’t magically have a case because you pile up paperwork. 

Law and order works here
[7/19/25, 12:24:42 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Anyway you have a Delaware c corp - when you file it with stripe or whatever you get bylaws document board seats 
So I assume you got this working for you without much effort - as it’s it’s there by default 
Unless I’m missing something
[7/19/25, 12:25:30 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Did you take extra steps did you take beyond that? As in outside of having extra board member to be able to fire you. 
Would be worth sharing that in case it helps c corp folks ‎<This message was edited>
[7/19/25, 3:08:42 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: As I said, Sid Law and Tax are interpretable. Having worked over decade in Investment Banking in US with many freinds who are CPAs. Have attached few links

Is a Board Required, Optional, or Just Good to Have?
A board of directors is legally required for corporations incorporated in Delaware. 
It's not optional—Delaware law mandates that the business and affairs of every corporation be managed by or under the direction of a board. 
While it's certainly a good practice for ensuring structured decision-making and compliance, 
the requirement stems from statutory obligations rather than mere recommendation

https://techstartuplawyer.com/incorporation/how-many-directors-do-i-need-for-the-board-of-directors/
https://codes.findlaw.com/de/title-8-corporations/de-code-sect-8-141/

Is Board Approval of Documents Required or Optional?
Board approval is required for significant financial transactions like shareholder loans in a C corporation, 
as it upholds corporate governance formalities under Delaware law (common for many C corps)

https://www.commenda.io/incorporation/delaware-c-corp
https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/bizfilings/state-guides/delaware-incorporation-requirements ‎<This message was edited>
[7/19/25, 3:17:47 PM] ~ Kartik Mehta: For a single owner Delaware corporation, having a board of directors is still legally required, but it can be simplified significantly.

You must have at least one director (this can be you, the single owner)
You can serve as the sole director of your own corporation
The "board" can literally be just you making decisions and documenting them in board resolutions

You wear multiple hats: owner (shareholder), director, and likely officer (CEO/President)
You still need to follow corporate formalities like holding annual board meetings and keeping minutes
Board resolutions are still required for major decisions, but you're voting on them yourself
You'll need to document decisions properly to maintain corporate liability protection  https://www.cairncross.com/blog/ch-news/the-role-of-the-board-of-directors/
[7/19/25, 3:24:05 PM] ~ S Kapoor: Is there a website or a service to get the details of a Delaware registered LLC?
[7/19/25, 4:57:10 PM] ~ Eric K.: https://icis.corp.delaware.gov/ecorp/entitysearch/namesearch.aspx
[7/19/25, 10:13:09 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You are again confusing the problem 
Not helpful. And don’t drop “my friends are cpa” etc 
Why did you join this group? 


Like I said - 
I was on a board myself when I register my c corp @ Delaware 
When you use stripe atlast or other services you get that by default. You are just repeating that as some major fact. I’m not debating that. 

None of this has to do with trump or immigration 

Now - Adding money into your own business 
Is that equity or loan? As it can be both 

It’s a better idea from founders like me and many of you here to qualify it as loan so you can easily take the money out without incurring taxes on income or dividends 

This requires that you do proper accounting for when you wire the money in and categorize the transaction accordingly 
Your bookkeeper will likely ask this question towards the end of the year if you have one. You add the right category to this amount so it shows as liability in your balance sheet. That’s it. 

Board approval etc depends on corporate structure bla bla and many things. We need to confused that for most of the bootstrapped H1B founders here. 

It’s basic accounting.
[7/19/25, 10:22:58 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Btw folks 
This is a classic example why immigration forums are full of orthogonal and unhelpful - in fact - depressing - advice 
People just talk what they know - one or two facts - without understanding the question or nuances in situation. That too with such authority that it scares many people. 

The gentleman here is stating facts 
But they irrelevant facts. 

For someone trying to understand how to accounting for the money I put in my LLC - this “you need meeting minutes” - just confounds the confusion instead of laying out exactly what and why 

And then to say - oh you must do it because trump is in office is totally illogical and exactly the kind of myth and paranoia that plagues most immigrants 

Now, nothing against Mr. K Mehta here per say. I think he means well.

[7/19/25, 11:15:09 PM] ~ Ros: Hey Sid, If I'm bootstrapping (and have to give myself a salary), is there any advantage of putting in my funds as a loan to my single member LLC vs just a cash transfer (capital contributions)? Given that its a disregarded entity I can move funds in and out of the business account as needed as I understand it. ‎<This message was edited>
[7/19/25, 11:25:13 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes you likely don’t have much of a tax win here with loan - AFAIK 

But worth just running this with ChatGPT o3 model

[7/21/25, 9:20:37 AM] ~ Falaknaaz: Hey everyone,
I’m looking for some guidance on navigating office space and F-1 visa status. If I’m partnering with a company that is based in India and I update this on LinkedIn, could this potentially affect my H-1B lottery chances?
Would the fact that the company is based in India pose any issues?

Has anyone been in a similar position - how did they navigate office space ?
[7/21/25, 10:10:36 AM] Sid Sarasvati: start with any of the podcast videos at h1bfounders.com
especially the early ones.
[7/21/25, 10:12:53 AM] Sid Sarasvati: Hi Falaknaaz - are these two questions or related? office and Indian partner 
And what did you update on LinkedIn?

I exported this chat and put it in gpt with a nice prompt. 

Maybe you find it helpful 

https://chatgpt.com/share/687e50e5-27b4-8011-825e-e1440b6b5439

I had a short chat history due to  phone change but someone should replicate this who has been in the group for longer and has chat history

[7/21/25, 3:11:42 PM] Sid Sarasvati: nice! not stuck per say, but we are looking to add one more dev - so if anything is looking for a part time gig. 
@⁨Ercan Ozer⁩ can connect with you quickly to see if the work fits. Just DM me or him.
[7/21/25, 4:25:52 PM] Sid Sarasvati: On Writing - While we not have the best tools humankind has ever had, writing is still a critical skill. Because writing is thinking! There is no difference as per psychologists. So if you find yourself lost and confused - write. 
That said, if you are a normal person - Writing is HARD. 
If you are paralyzed by writing, here is a solid guidance on writing any piece, something not obvious to many: [from the book On Clear Writing] 

'Nobody can write a book or an article “about” something. Tolstoy couldn’t write a book about war and peace, or Melville a book about whaling. They made certain *reductive* decisions about time and place and about individual characters in that time and place—*one man pursuing one whale*. 
**Every writing project must be reduced before you start to write.**’ 

Hope this helps. ‎<This message was edited>

[7/22/25, 8:27:51 PM] ~ Tom Mohan: That is true, but I think they gradually prioritize the extensions based on salary
[7/22/25, 8:31:38 PM] ~ Austin: I am aware, I'm just considering it in the context of "H1B Founders"
[7/22/25, 8:32:23 PM] ~ Austin: Especially new graduates
[7/22/25, 8:33:12 PM] ~ Tanmay: True but the proposal is mainly for the lottery chances.

No other agenda. We will see how we can something like this recurring and fruitful

Especially if you wanna bootstrap to profitable revenue & 95% gross profit ‎<This message was edited>
[7/26/25, 10:07:27 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You need to find the market 
And ride the wave
[7/26/25, 10:08:07 PM] ~ Kishan: New cycle as in?
[7/26/25, 10:11:46 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Markets have cycles, obviously these are macro economic views - you can be smart and believe one or the other 
There are no facts in economics - human behavior 

So consumers were deemed a very bad idea when I was an employee brewing my ideas - 2012 to 2022 
Something shifted after the pandemic, then the economic downturn, then AI boom 

Consumer is still hard. But 5 years ago I would have adviced everyone to NOT start with consumer 
You were likely to fail
[7/26/25, 10:26:59 PM] ~ Harshdeep Gupta: I am as well

You figure out distribution and you are golden 
$50K MRR easy
[7/26/25, 10:30:04 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Then can be expanded
[7/26/25, 10:34:52 PM] ~ Harshdeep Gupta: Oh wow, any perspectives you want to share on that @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ ? On the landing page and distribution experiments we can run?
[7/26/25, 10:38:44 PM] ~ Kishan: The interest because new companies built ground up would be low cost compared to current sas?
[7/26/25, 11:23:12 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I wills share more tomorrow

[7/28/25, 7:22:20 PM] ~ Harshdeep Gupta: When Claude code is a write off😏
[7/28/25, 7:39:59 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Yes. All of it is ‘context engineering’ 
which is say memory management in a way 

Also for those deep into claude code, they just launches subagents 
It’s an incredible evolution - https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents
[7/28/25, 7:43:32 PM] ~ Prajwal Pitlehra: good stuff- i recently gave this a shot -https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering

but yeah i think context management is the way to go

was setting up subagents a pain?
[7/28/25, 7:44:51 PM] Sid Sarasvati: I use claude itself to set it up :)
Just gave it the full subagent doc to read first
Was pretty simple
[7/28/25, 7:51:22 PM] ~ Prajwal Pitlehra: nice- been trying to figure out how to manage context and prevent fluffy results/ passing tests. Currently I use chatgpt as the project lead/ enforcer of non hallucinating code (i ask for code evidences) and cursor/ claude code for writing code, I then switch to manus for reviews. I create PRs using cursor. but it’s ofc become very baggy now. i’m bullish on what gpt-5 will bring
[7/28/25, 8:03:38 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Still very early days 
People have their workflows 

But I’m bullish on Claude code 
It’s likely to become the everything app

[7/29/25, 6:23:24 PM] ~ Maniisha: Hi Keerthi,

Can you help me understand, why do you want to apply for Y Combination and what are your expectations from YC.

Thank You.
[7/29/25, 6:26:53 PM] ~ Leela Yanamaddi: Isn’t it obvious? Funding, Reputation and Business Acceleration.
[7/29/25, 6:28:06 PM] ~ Harshdeep Gupta: I know someone who did and got in! Let me see if he is willing to share
[7/29/25, 6:31:23 PM] ~ Leela Yanamaddi: Here are few factors that can give a boost.
1. A refferal from past YC founders
2. ⁠some traction or validation of product(waitlists not considered any more especially in the age of AI)
3. ⁠Team Chemistry and Credentials
4. ⁠Going after Large TAM
5. ⁠Some niche expertise to bank on. Like exclusive work on FDA, Defence etc..
[7/29/25, 6:42:17 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Why would that be obvious? Maybe in the yc bubble 

Anyway - there application is easy. They like tech founders. And will force you to move to SF 

I’m not a fan. But I’m also not a fan of working for Silicon Valley (100x growth minded) VCs so take me with a grain of salt

[7/29/25, 8:31:03 PM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: YC to raise investment . I am  building a domain-specific AI platform focused on autism and neurodiverse communities.
[7/29/25, 8:31:25 PM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: Yes.
[7/29/25, 8:39:25 PM] ~ Sathiya Keerthi: I’ve never really explored these kinds of platforms before. So I’m planning to try YC and also look into other possibilities. maybe even grants or direct VC.

If you or anyone know of any good alternatives or have any suggestions, I’d really appreciate it!

From H1B to CEO: Key Lessons from the Panel

This event was a powerful reminder that your immigration journey in the U.S. doesn’t have to be controlled by luck or employer sponsorship. There are real, actionable paths to freedom, entrepreneurship, and even permanent residency—if you plan ahead.

🌟 Key Takeaways

1. You Can Take Control
Many immigrants feel stuck—tied to lottery chances, slow green card processes, or fearful of violating rules. But there are smarter, faster, and more flexible ways forward.

2. O-1 Visa (for Extraordinary Ability)
	•	3-year visa, unlimited renewals.
	•	No lottery or wage limits.
	•	You can be a solo founder, CEO, or CPO of your startup.
	•	Apply via your own company (employer model) or via an agent (consulting/freelancing).
	•	Meet just 3 of 8 criteria (like high pay, media mentions, judging, awards).
	•	Can lead to the EB1A green card.

3. EB1A Green Card
	•	Self-sponsored.
	•	For the top ~1% in a field (entrepreneurs, engineers, researchers).
	•	10 criteria (8 overlap with O-1).
	•	Great for startup founders with traction, judging roles, or industry recognition.
	•	No need to wait 10–15 years for a green card via your employer.

4. Common Missteps to Avoid
	•	Don’t use your work laptop for startup work (that’s company IP).
	•	Don’t take revenue while on H1B unless you’re authorized.
	•	Don’t travel while your EB1A is pending on an O-1 visa.

5. Start Early and Build Eligibility
You can become O-1 or EB1A eligible in 3–6 months if you:
	•	Take on judging roles at hackathons or conferences.
	•	Build press coverage and visibility.
	•	Show critical contributions and high-impact leadership.
	•	Collect recommendation letters and evidence from trusted leaders.

6. HR & People Leaders Can Help
Your manager is your biggest advocate—share your goals and align your efforts with the company’s mission. Many startups are open to flexible immigration strategies that retain great talent.

7. There Are Costs—But It’s Worth It
Costs can range from $5K to $30K depending on legal fees and case complexity. Doing it right the first time can save years of stress and uncertainty.

⸻

Final Advice from the Panel:
	•	Explore all your options.
	•	Don’t wait—plan and act.
	•	Talk to people who’ve done it.
	•	Build a roadmap.
	•	Take control of your future.

[7/30/25, 2:54:09 AM] ~ Hafsa Shams: Got a quote from one of the big well-known firms
[7/30/25, 2:54:10 AM] ~ Hafsa Shams: And they quoted 15k, fully refundable if there’s a rejection
[7/30/25, 2:54:17 AM] ~ Hafsa Shams: But I feel like 15k is very very steep
[7/30/25, 2:55:11 AM] ~ Hafsa Shams: Would be grateful if someone had suggestions for a good, hands-on immigration firm, especially one that doesn’t overcharge

[7/30/25, 6:28:42 PM] ~ Sharonachin: Hi everyone 👋🏾 🙂 I have a question, if someone is on H1B, sponsored by a company they work full time at, can they still create their own business or join another LLC business as a founder/owner while still on H1B? Thanks!
[7/30/25, 6:32:11 PM] ~ Sharonachin: If you have any documentation or links to any helpful websites, that would be great!
[7/30/25, 7:13:19 PM] ~ Mark: Afraid not....you could set up the LLC at any time...even do some ground work - the issues are around compensation...big no no....need the second H1b.
[7/30/25, 9:40:52 PM] ~ Sharonachin: Ohh I see. Okay, thanks so much for letting me know!
[7/31/25, 1:14:44 AM] ~ Sai: Looking for a solid technical co-founder to build an AI dev shop together.
The idea: Build AI copilots and automations for small/mid-sized businesses using LangChain, vector DBs, and n8n.
I’ll handle marketing and bringing in clients — that’s my expertise (paid ads for B2B and B2C).
You’d take charge of building and delivering the tech.
If you're into AI agents, automation, and building useful stuff that actually gets used — hit me up
[7/31/25, 2:01:57 AM] ~ Ros: Why langchain? Have you used it?
[7/31/25, 2:11:38 AM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Wondering the same. I would keep it to the abstract idea and let the incoming technical cofounder choose on architecture components
[7/31/25, 2:35:04 AM] ~ Sai: I used it but I am open to other similar tech , i just referred it because its popular and i am not big into the tech side
[7/31/25, 2:35:44 AM] ~ Sai: That’s really good idea Tq
[7/31/25, 11:24:36 AM] ~ Saurabh Sharma: Hi. I would be interested to learn more. Will message you
[7/31/25, 2:23:14 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Hi Founders, 

I’m in a bit of a fix and don’t know - I need some guidance.

I graduated in May and my OPT was approved in March so I filed for an EAD card in April. 

I have waited for a long time without getting my EAD card. 

1. I am currently doing an internship with a company and they are willing to retain me as full-time staff. 
2. ⁠I can’t accept the role or start work full-time until I get my EAD. 
3. ⁠The company appreciates my work and would desire to have me as a Full-time or Consultant. 
4. ⁠My company is registered both in my home country and the US. 
5. ⁠I can’t accept use full-time role, can I accept a consultant position using my company? 
6. ⁠Is there any advice regarding the EAD card or work? I’m a bit tired. 

Thank you, I appreciate responses.
[7/31/25, 2:35:30 PM] ~ Joy M: You might want to consider premium processing your application. You're the best judge of your circumstances, but if you think switching to full time at the earliest would benefit you and company, then doing premium might be worth it to get EAD within approx 14 days.
[7/31/25, 2:36:57 PM] ~ Miguel Millán: I did premium processing for my OPT and they approved it in 48h. The card took about one week to arrive. I think it’s $1.600 extra but if you’re in a hurry I think it’s worth it
[7/31/25, 2:42:22 PM] ~ Joy M: To answer your question, I think you need to have EAD to work in US regardless of the position. So, you might not be able to hold a consultant position if I'm not mistaken, unless anyone else can weigh in. You would still need EAD I think, so premium would be the way to go if the opportunity is not worth missing out on.
[7/31/25, 2:46:09 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: I could use my home company registration though.
[7/31/25, 2:46:27 PM] ~ Alfred Lazarus: Has anyone ever contacted them directly? I will appreciate.
[7/31/25, 4:16:47 PM] ~ Kishan: hey guys any recommendations for a shared office workplace for h1b application? in the nyc area?
[7/31/25, 5:42:24 PM] ~ Siva: Hi guys. Any cpa recommendations?
[7/31/25, 6:24:57 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: @⁨~NISHIL SHAH⁩ does a great job for us.
[7/31/25, 7:32:25 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: You would be violating your visa status. If you are in f1 - you are not authorized to work until you have your EAD. 

Where your company is registered is secondary - you can work if you were outside of US. Inside US, f1 rules are applicable

[8/7/25, 12:35:21 PM] ~ Dhruv Parikh: Hey folks — I’ve been getting the itch to build again, so thought I’d put this out there: if anyone’s looking for a business-side co-founder or early team member, I’d love to chat and brainstorm.

Quick bit about me: I was Director of Strategy & Fundraising at a $500M+ clean tech startup, where I co-led a $31M round backed by Samsung and others. Before that, I was at McKinsey, did a stint in VC,, and founded a deep-tech venture. I’m a Wharton MBA and IIT Bombay grad.

Always up for a chat—just ping me!
[8/7/25, 5:08:35 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Hello All - I am looking for some insights on deployment platforms to use for AI/ML based applications. I realize  Vercel is pretty popular for static websites but apps with AI features, what is recommended? Does Heroku work better? @⁨Sid Sarasvati⁩ I know you have been vocal about Claude Code, what do use for deployment?? Thanks 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/7/25, 5:11:10 PM] ~ Tanmay: Use vercel for frontend + nextjs. If building pipelines ,AI , ML infra. Aws hands down, credits helps a lot and very scalable and cheap
[8/7/25, 5:12:37 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: You mean some sort of founders credit ?
[8/7/25, 5:12:56 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Probably I heard somewhere
[8/7/25, 5:53:20 PM] ~ Sanjay: If you use stripe atlas to register your firm I think you get somewhere around 10-50k in AWS credits
[8/7/25, 5:53:34 PM] ~ Sanjay: And around the same figure in azure OpenAI credits as well
[8/7/25, 6:24:34 PM] Sid Sarasvati: depends on kind of deployment 
in my assessment couldflare is top of top for static web apps - don’t use nextjs bloat and vercel nonsense - use react + tailwind + shadcn/ui and maybe vite for build system 
It’s all FREE 
storage for images are pretty cheap of CF as well 
+ you get security and free edge deployment 

for backend we use digitialocean $5 for small machine - easier than wrangling EC2 and docker on AWS - but I don’t deal with that much so some backend person can help you 

That said - Azuer and GCP will give you free startup credits - we got it - simple application. use that. But either way our cost has never been v high - literally we run on 96% gross profit. Most of it is GPU cost. 

for GPU - start with replicate if you are early, then find a GPU machine on runpod or similar services 
We host our own GPUs - rendering 10 million+ images per month ‎<This message was edited>

[8/8/25, 6:04:48 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: You need to have a registered entity in California unless it’s a contractor

[8/8/25, 6:58:22 PM] Sid Sarasvati: full time doesn’t mean w2 
you can hire full time on contract - 1099 
w2 is complex 
bunch of state compliance 
I recommend you don’t outside of home state
[8/8/25, 7:00:02 PM] Sid Sarasvati: the solution here is called EOR - employer of record 
Deel and other they hire on your behalf in other states and international if you need to offer benifits etc to hires like actual employees
[8/8/25, 7:32:09 PM] ~ Abhishek Wahane: STEM-OPT needs employer-employee relationship and student needs to be supervised.

Contractors cannot be supervised and are not employees. 

You would either have to hire as employee (company needs to be E-verified), 
or through EOR like Deel.
[8/8/25, 7:52:22 PM] ~ Ajay Ganesh: Correct ^

[8/9/25, 2:51:40 PM] ~ Tanmay: Thanks for all the answers above
[8/9/25, 5:06:54 PM] Sid Sarasvati: You can 
I have done it 

And let’s be precise 
I assume by “them” you mean person on opt extension? 

You need to be e-verified 
And can hire them on 1099 
They need to get it approved by their DSO
It depends on the DSO of their school ‎<This message was edited>

[8/9/25, 5:23:28 PM] ~ Akshyae Singh: Hey everyone, I’m a recent grad  from ucla , studied human intelligence and AI , now on an OPT (https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshyaesingh) I currently have been figuring out some startup stuff, but my 3 months unemployment time is about to end soon, as I have to declare my employer. Right now the startup stuff is pretty early stage so I’m hesitant to register a company (prolly as Delaware c corp) ,cuz I don’t want to have to deal with taxes, other formalities if I don’t pursue the startup stuff. Alternatively I could look for a low effort job that i could declare on my portal (lemme know if any of u have any opportunities, experienced in AI, growth, PM hehe) ‎<This message was edited>
[8/9/25, 5:23:51 PM] ~ Akshyae Singh: Would love any advice
[8/9/25, 5:52:01 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: My advice would be to seek and demonstrate clarity.

Figure out what you want, which it looks like from your post is that you are looking for employment, and if so, write a message focused on that.

Mention what you bring to the table, what you are looking for, and that you are all in on it. 

In this times, looking for a “low effort” job does not make sense.
[8/9/25, 5:59:30 PM] ~ Akshyae Singh: I’m pretty clear that I see myself going on the startup path but wondering if it makes sense to register an early stage startup as an international with a lot of uncertainties. The only reason I’d be doing it so early without proof of concept is so i can declare it for OPT. Wondering if a better path might be to go for a part time job or something so I can report to uscis

[8/14/25, 8:52:24 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Hello folks. I have a question for H1B founders.

If I create a Delaware C corp via stripe atlas, and after want to hire employee (myself, on h1b) in another state (in WA, both working and residing),  is it correct that I will need to do this steps before filing LCA:

- register as foreign business in WA
- ⁠get WA state business license

I think I know the answer, but the hope here is to see if it can be done without. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/16/25, 2:49:56 PM] ~ Nadeem Khasim: Whats the advantage of registering a business in WA?
[8/16/25, 2:50:11 PM] ~ Nadeem Khasim: Why dont you do it in your home state and make things simple
[8/16/25, 5:08:52 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: Make a wild guess!!
[8/16/25, 5:09:46 PM] ~ Tanmay: You dont need to register again as a foreign entity if you register in Delaware you would have to do that to
Work in WA
[8/16/25, 6:51:17 PM] ~ Divya Saini: Wait, so if I have incorporated in Delaware and I have an employee (myself as founder) in a different state (let's say WA), I don't need to register as an entity in WA?
[8/16/25, 6:53:12 PM] ~ Tanmay: I think you would need to , depends on state laws. I know for california you do need to register as foreign entity to be able to hire W-2 employees for a delaware C corp

Can I have suggestion for opening brokerage account to invest in stocks.

For example robinhood is a very prevalent go to for individuals looking to invest. Looking for similar for a business trying to invest.

Traditional robinhood individual account I believe is not the way to go for putting in funds from individual checking account, probably wont even allow it.

[8/27/25, 1:51:34 PM] ~ Shobhit G: For how long? I think LTV/CAC ratio will define the worth :)
[8/27/25, 1:52:42 PM] ~ Sanjay: Yup
[8/27/25, 1:52:43 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: I thought of the same but also concluded it would really depend on the company how long they are able to retain
[8/27/25, 1:54:49 PM] ~ Rushabh Doshi: The way I see it is for someone who has a plan on acquiring users and is executing fairly well along the lines, the CAC might be sound pretty high

But for someone who is only thinking but not actually able to manage execution, and has funds, this might be a good starting point.
[8/27/25, 2:02:22 PM] ~ Joyboy: Credit cards spend about 300-700$ to acquire customers  and break even 3-5 years later.

But it’s a competitive market. Well established.

Where as startups nowadays targeting 18-30 are so good; their marketing spend is negligible, organic marketing is at its best.

So idk if I feel good about spending any $ irrespective of all the ratios as “founders”
[8/27/25, 2:07:01 PM] ~ Joyboy: The average conversation rate overall , golden standard, 2% for most channels.


So the first 50$ actually comes after marketing to 50 people 😅
That’s,  50*300 $
[8/27/25, 2:09:32 PM] ~ R: It also depends on the industry you’re targeting to. Can’t generalize
[8/27/25, 2:15:03 PM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[8/27/25, 2:15:47 PM] Sid Sarasvati: $300 is CAC

[8/27/25, 2:17:15 PM] Sid Sarasvati: 300$ is CAC of paid user not for impression; it accounts for conversion 
Assume that
[8/27/25, 2:17:56 PM] Sid Sarasvati: SaaS == internet business 
assume agnostic to industry ‎<This message was edited>
[8/27/25, 2:18:51 PM] ~ Hemanth Shivasubramaniam: Isn't LTV going to be $50 x average life of customer (in months)
[8/27/25, 2:19:50 PM] ~ Joyboy: The average life of product for me is 7 days ( free trial) 😴😴

Except gpt pro😝 ‎<This message was edited>
[8/27/25, 2:24:19 PM] Sid Sarasvati: To be clear. My question (I can’t edit it there sigh) - that given the requirement for a SaaS product, can you achieve this?
[8/27/25, 2:24:20 PM] ~ Joyboy: +1 ?
[8/27/25, 2:26:36 PM] ~ Joyboy: Ya can be achieved.

Many b2b tools are in the price range of 50-100.

Let’s assume zoom business.

And you let customers refer other customers for 150$ referral, you can do it for cheaper too
[8/27/25, 2:34:20 PM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[8/27/25, 2:49:50 PM] ~ Kishan: Not sure if the ask is to understand if it’s worth it or achieve it - again it depends on how much use user pays their life time if it’s break even it’s a no brainer / anything less - then all depends on risk appetite
[8/27/25, 3:39:09 PM] ~ Anupam Arora: $50 for how many months? is it guaranteed the customer will come for that many months and ability to move up the customer for more value down the line.. few things to think about
[8/27/25, 5:07:47 PM] ~ Harshdeep Gupta: For 10 customers, you have $3000 in budget and have to acquire $500 in revenue. 

Is there a duration contract for this revenue?  Potential network effects? Testimonials to help make future CAC lower? Plan to make product better with feedback? Attracting VCs with this revenue and growth? What is the end goal?

With the information given:
$50 seems low ticket, would need to be a self service sign up and onboarding. Can’t hire sales rep at this price.

Once you have some good creatives/outreach/funnel (that itself might take ~$1500 to test and find?), I think these number should be possible, we are most likely loosing money anyways. 

I think it depends so much on the experience of the operator doing it. 

I personally have burned ~$100 in ads, and don’t have paying customers to show for it yet.
While people out there seem to have funnels with ROAS of 7+ and more.
[8/28/25, 11:35:28 AM] ~ Rana Naidu: Need Backend Engineer (Python + Full-Stack)

[8/28/25, 7:46:36 PM] ~ Tanmay: How do you plan to compete with cal ai and similar apps ?
[8/28/25, 7:46:38 PM] ~ Tanmay: Distribution?
[8/28/25, 7:51:23 PM] ~ Aadi: I know We are also in early stage only
[8/28/25, 7:52:04 PM] ~ Aadi: Cal Ai is just about calories 
this app would be much bigger than that
but again depends on marketing strategies
[8/28/25, 7:52:30 PM] ~ Aadi: I have been following Cal AI since long and its an amazing app but have limitations too
[8/28/25, 8:45:31 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Ah didn’t realize it was YOUR app 
I thought you mentioned a popular app 
Well good luck. Solid market for such apps 
Ai is changing what possible now. Earlier It would take a team of 15 PHDs for such computer vision projects

[8/29/25, 5:55:47 PM] ~ Sanjay: You can check out stripe atlas and setup an llc
[8/29/25, 6:32:49 PM] ~ Mahendra Varma: One of the points that was shared on last week’s call was setting up an LLC on H-1B, rather than a C-corp and setting up a board to make it possible for hiring yourself. An LLC could be interesting for few reasons like privacy and lower fees. Could one of you who opened an LLC share your strategy on how you were able to show a manager over you? Thank you in advance.
[8/30/25, 12:02:13 AM] ~ Akshyae Singh: As a young founder, and someone who’s been into entrepreneurship since a young age, I really don’t think there’s a need to register any entity to learn/boost learning. I think doing things like improving and iterating product through costumer feedback, getting new costumers, running mock finances and proformas, learning how to code, building a team — all these can be done without the need of entity registration if the goal is to learn and boost morale as well! I think learning foundations is more helpful. Once those things are learned, I think things like entity registration etc, your kid can learn along the way.
[8/30/25, 12:03:47 AM] ~ Akshyae Singh: @⁨~Kaustubh⁩ I think if your daughter wants to start a company, start with addressing a pain point, talking to potential costumers of that pain point, build a solution, iterate! Learning this cycle is foundational. ‎<This message was edited>

[8/30/25, 12:09:53 AM] ~ Vikram Shete: If LTV of a month is an average of 50 for a cac of 300..
This business is Amazon in its early stages. Not sustainable on its own and will require massive money dumps. 

Having said that, it should be easy to achieve this ROAS of 0.16 ( ideally should be 3 or higher) standard assumption of targeted audience apply.

[9/3/25, 4:01:02 PM] Sid Sarasvati: “how does a corp attorney help in the USCIS filing “ 
They don’t. Very diff world. Most corporate attorney woudl know less amount immigration then the least informed person in this group. It’s not how they make money. 
lawyers live in very diff worlds 

It’s like asking a kernel programmer working on a single codebase for 20 years about the latest frontend library - they could know- but they don’t; they are both software engineers
[9/3/25, 4:01:53 PM] Sid Sarasvati: So you need to frame the questions to them to get most out of them
[9/3/25, 4:02:12 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Sorry let me be specific.  Does corp attorney help with any paper work that is needed for H1B filing ??
[9/3/25, 4:02:58 PM] ~ Dushyant Sengar: Do I need to employ their services or they mostly help with business plans, bylaws which ChatGPT can help ?
[9/3/25, 4:17:23 PM] ~ Mark: Any regular corp attorney is walking a dangerous line if they are attempting H1b paperwork them selves, unless they have learned by their mistakes....fraught with danger to not engage a REAL Immigration lawyer.

[9/3/25, 4:48:39 PM] Sid Sarasvati: Hey everyone! Quick announcement about something I'm launching based on the conversations we've been having.

I just recorded the first episode of my *Tough Love Coaching* series with Swapnil - and it was incredible. Real talk, no fluff, actual breakthroughs.

Here's the deal: I'm opening *5 exclusive slots* for H1B founders who want my unfiltered feedback. This is the same coaching I charge $500/hour for - you get it free if you're okay with us recording and sharing it with the community.

*We already have 3 slots filled*:

• Episode 1: Swapneel ✅ (recorded)
• Episode 2: Akshyae (booked)
• Episode 3: Rana (booked)

*That leaves 2 slots for September.*

What you get:

• 45-60 min 1:1 with me
• Direct feedback on what's actually holding you back
• Clear action steps (not theory)
• Recording helps thousands of other founders

What I need from you:

• Be specific about what you're building
• Ready for honest truth (it's called tough love for a reason)
• Okay with recording being shared (we'll remove sensitive stuff)

If you're interested, @⁨~Maniisha⁩ will drop the application form shortly. We're using this to select the final 2 founders.

This isn't about being mean - it's about cutting through the BS that's keeping
you stuck. Every founder I talk to has the same patterns, and gentle advice
isn't fixing them.

If this goes well, I'll open more slots next month. But for now - 5 total, 2 remaining.

Let's go! ‎<This message was edited>
[9/3/25, 4:51:37 PM] ~ Mark: Nice job Sid.👍
[9/3/25, 4:54:49 PM] ‎You: ‎You pinned a message
[9/3/25, 5:02:36 PM] ~ Joyboy: Oh yes !

I was the first to take the heat guys. 

Got grilled and honestly after the conversation with Sid 

I pitched my idea to 10+ people in the next week and everytime I  improve drastically.

The perfect doesn’t exist but I definitely got some great insights on things I shouldn’t miss like target audience , the USP , the problem. 

Even though we know what they are , a third perspective puts you on top 🙌🏻
[9/3/25, 5:04:27 PM] ~ Joyboy: Ps : I rather make mistakes with a supporter than an investor
[9/3/25, 6:28:47 PM] Gaurav Shah: I am interested in one slot with recording
[9/3/25, 6:32:31 PM] ~ Maniisha: Hey Gaurav please check your DM
[9/3/25, 6:33:08 PM] ~ Maniisha: Hey Joyboy,

I’d say I was the OG, still grinding every week 😎. Trust me, you’ll end up thanking Sid like 100 times over, the reality check hits harder than “raw,” “rawer,” and “the rawest” combined 😂. Loving every brutal, beautiful moment of it!
[9/3/25, 7:28:49 PM] ~ Maniisha: Hello H1B Founders Fam,

We’re excited to share the final opportunity for this September to connect with SID. Secure your spot using the link below:

[9/4/25, 9:01:24 PM] ~ Kishan: Me - got a mail pretending to be OpenSea upgrade and lost all my coins in the wallet
[9/4/25, 9:10:52 PM] ~ Tanmay: Lost few ETH :) in 2024 

Got an online assignment for a job which made me download like a lockdown browser kinda thing and  I downloaded it. I was actually giving the test and it had tech questions but while I was giving the test I think they got access to my mac file directory or smth and stole the private key. Yes it was encrypted  but my dumbass had the encrption key in my apple notes which they somehow saw it or smth not sure exactly how.

Now I have 4 step safety mechanism which involves physical hardware and stuff
