### Opening Hook (The Pain)
"I have been in the US for 15 years. I still have to maintain my H1B visa status i.e I lose my job, I get deported in 60 days."

### The Problem Statement
"H1B - is a work based visa that makes you a US resident with zero safety net. On top, many on employment based visas believe they cannot start a company in the US until they receive their green cards. I am part of a few WhatsApp groups dedicated to this topic."

### The Outrage
"It cannot be more anti-American to curb and discourage entrepreneurial spirit amongst hard working group of legal immigrants. I have been through this. I hereby share this article to shed some light on the matter."
