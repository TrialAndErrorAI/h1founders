# Pattern Language for Founder Coaching

> **"A pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice."**
> ‚Äî Christopher Alexander, *A Pattern Language*

## What Is This?

This is a **Pattern Language** for coaching founders ‚Äî a structured collection of reusable coaching frameworks extracted from real sessions with real founders.

Just like Design Patterns gave software engineers a shared vocabulary (Strategy, Observer, Factory), this gives founder coaches a language for recurring coaching challenges.

## The Philosophy

### From Practice, Not Theory

Every pattern here was:
1. **Discovered** in actual coaching sessions
2. **Tested** across multiple founders
3. **Refined** through iteration
4. **Validated** by measurable outcomes (breakthroughs, progress, behavior change)

We don't invent patterns. We **extract** them from what already works.

### A Solution to a Problem in Context

Each pattern has three parts:

1. **The Problem** - A recurring challenge founders face (e.g., analysis paralysis, competitor fear, burnout)
2. **The Context** - When this problem appears (stage, mindset, situation)
3. **The Solution** - A reusable coaching framework that addresses it

This is Christopher Alexander's architecture pattern language applied to coaching.

### Progressive Validation

Patterns move through stages:

- **Experimental** (0-1 uses): New pattern, unproven
- **Emerging** (1 use): Used once, seems promising
- **Validated** (2+ uses): Proven across multiple founders, ready for book

The database auto-promotes patterns as they're used. Natural selection for coaching frameworks.

## The Categories

### üîç Diagnostic Patterns
How to identify root causes, map dependencies, surface hidden blocks.

### üß† Mindset Patterns
Reframes, perspective shifts, identity work, belief system updates.

### üéØ Tactical Patterns
Concrete systems, homework frameworks, execution structures.

### ü§ù Accountability Patterns
Self-enforcing commitment mechanisms, show-up structures.

### üé® Metaphor Patterns
Analogies that land, stories that reframe, language that unlocks.

### üîÑ Sequence Patterns
Multi-pattern flows for specific coaching journeys (e.g., "First Session Sequence").

## How to Use This

### For Coaches

1. **Before sessions**: Review patterns for client's situation
2. **During sessions**: Apply patterns naturally (not rigid scripts)
3. **After sessions**: Log which patterns you used + outcomes
4. **Over time**: Build your own pattern repertoire

### For Founders Being Coached

These patterns work because they're **true** ‚Äî extracted from founders like you who broke through the same challenges.

When your coach uses a pattern language, you benefit from the collective wisdom of everyone who came before.

### For AI Assistants (Atlas)

1. **Load context**: `/pattern-context` before coaching prep
2. **Extract patterns**: `/extract-patterns` after session transcripts
3. **Sync catalog**: `/pattern-sync` to regenerate INDEX.md
4. **Query patterns**: `/pattern-query` for insights and connections

The database tracks everything automatically. Just follow the protocols.

## The Architecture

### Hybrid System

- **Database** (coaching_crm.db): Metadata, counts, relationships, status
- **Filesystem** (patterns/): Full pattern content, examples, context
- **INDEX.md**: Auto-generated catalog from DB (never edit manually)

Why hybrid?
- DB prevents AI counting errors (triggers auto-increment)
- Filesystem enables fast context loading for AI
- Best of both: accuracy + speed

### The Protocol Thinking

This architecture follows **Protocol Thinking** principles:

- **Right behavior is easy**: DB triggers make status promotion automatic
- **Single source of truth**: DB owns counts, files own content
- **Foreign key enforcement**: Prevents broken relationships
- **Natural promotion**: Patterns earn validation through usage
- **No manual tracking**: Structure creates correct behavior

## The Vision: A Book

This pattern language will eventually become a published book:

**"Design Patterns for Founders: A Pattern Language for Coaching"**

Each pattern = a chapter. Each category = a section. Sequences = part IV.

The book writes itself through real coaching. We just extract and refine.
