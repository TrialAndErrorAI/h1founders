Remember: Organization is key. USCIS officers spend ~15 minutes on each case. Make it easy for them to say YES.

Here's what I'm seeing:
1. Fraud has reached unprecedented levels (780K registrations for 85K spots)
2. Big Tech is lobbying hard for change
3. USCIS is already testing wage-based selection

What this means for you:
- If you're waiting for the lottery: STOP. Start building NOW.
- Revenue and value creation will become the primary criteria
- Self-sponsored founders will have a massive advantage

The future belongs to builders, not lottery winners.

This is not speculation. This is what's coming. Prepare accordingly.`,

Month 1-3: Research & Validation
- Talked to 200+ potential customers
- Built MVP in 2 weeks (no-code first)
- Got 5 beta users

Month 4-9: Product-Market Fit
- Iterated based on feedback
- Hired first contractor on Upwork
- Hit $10K MRR

Month 10-18: Scale
- Raised $500K from angels (all remote, no equity given to US persons)
- Hired 3 full-time engineers (all remote)
- Automated everything possible
- Now at $25K MRR ($300K ARR)

Key lessons:
1. Start before you're ready
2. Your H1B is an asset (global perspective)
3. Revenue solves all immigration problems
