      "content": "# UPDATE: White House Clarifies H-1B (Your Fear Was Valid, But We Can Do Better)\n\n*September 21, 2025*\n\nFriday night, the H-1B world exploded. \n\nIf you were outside the country, you had every right to panic. Without clarification, you could have been locked out forever. Corporate lawyers told people to fly back by Saturday. The fear was real.\n\nThe White House just released clarification. Current visa holders can breathe again.\n\nBut here's what we learned: In moments of crisis, the difference between panic and clarity often comes down to how we consume information, not just what information exists.\n\n## The Timeline of Truth vs Panic\n\n### Friday 8:16 PM: I Published Facts\n- Analyzed the actual proclamation text\n- Told you it applies to NEW petitions only\n- Said current visa holders are safe\n- Predicted clarification would come\n\n**Your response**: 10,500+ views, 91 shares, viral spread\n\n### Friday Night - Saturday: The Panic Machine Activated\nCorporate compliance departments sent emergency memos. WhatsApp groups exploded. One member shared:\n\n> \"Corp lawyers have definitely created a lot of panic! The rule only applies to Feb 26 lottery participants\"\n\nAnother observed:\n\n> \"Lawyers will always give you the safest answer. This is because if they give a generous answer and it doesn't work out, people blame the lawyer.\"\n\nThe fear-first consulting industry was having a field day.\n\n### Saturday Afternoon: Official Clarification Drops\n\nThe White House released an [official FAQ](https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/09/h-1b-faq/). \n\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt confirmed on X:\n> \"The $100K H-1B fee is a one-time fee, not annual, and only applied to new H-1B visas, not renewals.\"\n\nUSCIS published their [implementation memo](https://www.uscis.gov/sites/default/files/document/memos/H1B_Proc_Memo_FINAL.pdf).\n\nEverything we said Friday? Confirmed.\n\n## What the Official Documents Actually Say\n\n### From the White House FAQ:\n1. **Effective Date**: After 12:01 AM EDT on September 21, 2025\n2. **Who's Affected**: Only NEW H-1B petitions \n3. **Who's NOT Affected**:\n   - Current H-1B visa holders\n   - Renewals of existing visas\n   - Petitions filed before September 21\n   - Current valid H-1B holders outside the country (can re-enter without fee)\n\n### The $100K Fee:\n- Required for NEW petitions filed after September 21\n- One-time fee (not annual)\n- **The Big Question**: Transfers and extensions\n\n## The Uncertainty Everyone Needs to Acknowledge\n\n**Are transfers and extensions considered \"new petitions\"?**\n\nHere's what we know:\n- USCIS memo suggests \"changes of status and extensions of stay should be possible without the fee\" if you stay in the US\n- BUT if you exit for visa stamping after filing post-Sept 21, current guidance suggests you might need to pay\n- The proclamation seems to target beneficiaries OUTSIDE the United States\n\nFrom our WhatsApp group, the confusion was real:\n\n> \"Transfers / COE are technically new petitions.\"\n\n> \"Let's wait a week and we would know everything. The transfers are considered new petitions or not and all that stuff\"\n\n**The honest answer**: We don't know yet. And neither do the corporate advisory firms charging you $500/hour - they're just better at sounding certain while saying \"maybe.\"\n\n## Community Wisdom Beat Corporate Panic\n\nOur WhatsApp group of 850+ founders stayed grounded. Some gems:\n\n**When panic peaked**, one member said:\n> \"Unless this is official please don't make decisions on anonymous sources. Too much at stake for folks and they have no accountability\"\n\n**On media coverage**:\n> \"India based news sources are absolutely terrible in journalistic integrity when it comes to US immigration news. They understand absolutely nothing\"\n\n**The wisdom that cut through the noise**:\n> \"Unless this is official please don't make decisions on anonymous sources. Too much at stake for folks and they have no accountability\"\n\nAnd my response when fear-mongering peaked:\n> \"Banned and blocked. We stay in founder mode.\"\n\n## The Lesson: We All Have Access to the Same Information\n\nHere's what's important to understand: The source documents are PUBLIC. The proclamation text, the White House FAQ, the USCIS memo - all public.\n\nYes, the original proclamation was vague. Yes, people outside the country faced real risk. The fear was justified.\n\nBut the panic was amplified by how we consumed information. WhatsApp forwards. Panic tweets. Corporate memos written by lawyers protecting themselves, not you.\n\nYou're founders. You read complex technical documentation. You debug code. You analyze market data. You have the same ability to read government documents.\n\nAs I told the group:\n> \"There is no lawyer in 5 years who won't use AI to full research past precedence. Lawyers are as bad or as good as AI. It's interpretation and precedence.\"\n\nThe difference isn't access to information. It's confidence in our ability to understand it.\n\n## What You Actually Need to Do\n\n### If you're a current H-1B holder:\n- Nothing changes for you\n- Travel for stamping remains the same (if petition was filed before Sept 21)\n- Renewals proceed as normal (no $100K fee)\n\n### If you're planning to apply:\n- 2025 lottery (this year) - UNCLEAR (watch for clarification)\n- 2026 lottery onwards - Budget for $100K fee\n- Start planning alternative paths (O-1, EB-1A, etc.)\n\n### If you're changing jobs:\n- Inside US: Likely no fee for extensions/transfers (per USCIS memo)\n- If you leave for stamping: Might trigger fee (unclear)\n- Don't make decisions based on rumors - wait for explicit guidance\n\n### Important Timeline:\n- Proclamation expires September 21, 2026 (unless extended)\n- DHS can grant exemptions for \"national interest\"\n- New rules coming for prevailing wage levels and lottery prioritization\n\n## The Real Story Here\n\nThis wasn't about the proclamation. It was about how information spreads in our community.\n\n**Pattern 1**: Government announces vague policy  \n**Pattern 2**: Advisory firms amplify fear  \n**Pattern 3**: Community panics  \n**Pattern 4**: Clarification comes  \n**Pattern 5**: Nothing was as bad as feared  \n\nWe broke this pattern. By staying calm, reading sources, and thinking critically, we saved our community from 48 hours of unnecessary panic.\n\n## The Incompetence Factor\n\nWhen asked why the government was contradicting itself, one member said it best:\n\n> \"Cos they're stoopid. Ill-thought out, just like the rest of their destruction.\"\n\nThe fact that the proclamation expires right when the 2026 lottery visas would activate shows the level of planning here. As another member noted:\n\n> \"This proclamation is applicable to 2026 lottery, and those visas will be activated in Oct 2026, but proclamation is valid until September 2026. So much Stupidity 🤣\"\n\n## Moving Forward: Building Crisis Resilience Together\n\nThe H-1B system is broken. The communication was terrible. People outside the country had hours to make life-changing decisions. That's inexcusable.\n\nBut we can't control the government's incompetence. We can only control our response.\n\nWhen the next crisis hits (and it will), here's how we handle it better:\n1. Acknowledge the fear (it's usually valid)\n2. Find the PRIMARY source \n3. Read it together as a community\n4. Share interpretations, not panic\n5. Wait for clarification before making irreversible decisions\n\nThis weekend showed our community's strength. Yes, there was panic. But there was also wisdom:\n- Members calling out misinformation\n- People sharing primary sources\n- Voices of reason emerging\n\nJoin H1 Founders Network while it's still open: https://chat.whatsapp.com/L7sHBIbCuyx2cYvzuaDCat\n\nWe're at 900+ members and growing fast. Once we hit 1,000, we're closing the doors.\n\nStay strong. The system is against us, but we have each other.\n\n---\n\n*H1B Founders: 850+ strong. While others spread fear, we ship products.*\n\n**P.S.** - If you were traveling this weekend, I hope you're safe. The stress you faced was real and unfair.\n\n**P.P.S.** - Together we're stronger than any single lawyer's interpretation. 850 founders reading and thinking together beats panic every time.\n\n**P.P.P.S.** - The government may be incompetent, but our community isn't. We'll keep getting better at this.",

      "content": "# Trump's $100K H1B Proclamation: What It Actually Means (Stop Panicking)\n\n*September 19, 2025 - 8:00 PM ET*\n\nI'm watching our WhatsApp group explode with panic right now. Let me break down what this proclamation ACTUALLY says, not what lawyers want you to fear.\n\n## The Actual Facts\n\nTrump just signed a proclamation requiring a $100,000 payment for H1B petitions. It goes into effect September 21, 2025 (this Sunday) for 12 months.\n\nBut here's what everyone's missing:\n\n## Who This ACTUALLY Affects\n\n**READ Section 1(b) and 3(a) carefully:**\n\nThe $100K requirement applies to \"H-1B specialty occupation workers...who are **currently outside the United States**\" and \"aliens who **enter or attempt to enter** the United States.\"\n\n### You're NOT Affected If:\n- ✅ **H1B Transfer** - You're already in the US changing employers\n- ✅ **H1B Extension** - You're extending your current H1B\n- ✅ **F1 to H1B** - You're changing status while in the US\n- ✅ **Self-Sponsorship** - You're already here starting your company\n- ✅ **Currently in US** - You're not leaving the country\n\n### You ARE Affected If:\n- ❌ **New H1B from abroad** - Company trying to bring you from India/elsewhere\n- ❌ **Outsourcing companies** - Infosys, TCS, Wipro bringing consultants\n- ❌ **First-time H1B** - You're outside US trying to come in\n\n## The Big Unknown: Re-entry\n\n**Critical question:** If you leave the US to visit family, can you come back without paying $100K?\n\nThe proclamation is ambiguous. It says \"enter or attempt to enter\" but also talks about \"petitions accompanied by payment.\" You don't file a petition to re-enter with a valid visa.\n\n**My interpretation:** Re-entry with valid visa should be fine. But I wouldn't travel until we get clarification.\n\n## Why This Is Actually Good for You\n\nIf you're an H1B holder already in the US, this proclamation just made you MORE valuable:\n\n1. **Your replacement costs $100K more** - Companies can't just replace you with cheaper labor\n2. **Outsourcing firms are dead** - They can't pay $100K per consultant\n3. **Your negotiating power increased** - You're now expensive to replace\n4. **Self-sponsorship unchanged** - You can still start your company\n\n## Legal Reality Check\n\nLet's be clear about what this is:\n\n- **It's a proclamation, not law** - Can be challenged in court\n- **12-month duration** - Expires September 2026\n- **Has exemptions** - \"National interest\" waiver possible\n- **Will face lawsuits** - Remember what happened to other immigration proclamations?\n\nPresidential proclamations get reversed all the time. Remember the H4 EAD drama? Still here. The \"Buy American Hire American\" order? Didn't stop H1Bs.\n\n## What You Should Actually Do\n\n### If You're in the US:\n1. **Don't panic** - You're likely not affected\n2. **Don't travel internationally** - Wait for clarification\n3. **Focus on your business** - This changes nothing for self-sponsorship\n4. **Consider O1** - Not affected by this at all\n\n### If You're Outside the US:\n1. **F1 student route** - Still viable\n2. **O1 visa** - Completely unaffected\n3. **L1 visa** - Not mentioned in proclamation\n4. **Wait it out** - 12 months isn't forever\n\n## The Real Target\n\nRead the proclamation carefully. It's aimed at:\n- IT outsourcing companies\n- \"Body shops\" undercutting wages\n- Companies laying off Americans while hiring H1Bs\n\nIt's NOT aimed at:\n- Legitimate high-skilled workers\n- Founders building companies\n- People already contributing to the US economy\n\n## Stop Listening to Fear Merchants\n\nI'm already seeing lawyers posting \"EMERGENCY WEBINARS\" and \"URGENT CONSULTATION\" offers. They feed on your fear.\n\nThe same people who told you:\n- \"H1B is dead\" in 2017 (still here)\n- \"H4 EAD will end\" in 2019 (still here)  \n- \"Green cards impossible\" in 2020 (people still getting them)\n\n## The Bottom Line\n\nIf you're in the US, you're probably fine. If you're planning to travel, wait for clarification. If you're building a business, keep building.\n\nThe hardest part is actually having a business. Rest all is solvable.\n\nThis too shall pass. Every administration tries this. Courts push back. Business lobbies fight. Life goes on.\n\nIn my experience, these proclamations create more noise than actual change.\n\nFocus on what you can control: Your business, your skills, your network.\n\nStop reading immigration forums. Start building your company.\n\n---\n\n*Questions?

Consult an immigration attorney for your specific situation. But maybe wait until Monday when they've actually read it too.*",

      "content": "# H-1B & F-1 Visa Overhaul: What the New Final Rule Means for Aspiring Immigrant Founders\n\n*December 18, 2024 - Department of Homeland Security/USCIS Final Rule*\n\nThe immigration landscape just shifted in favor of immigrant entrepreneurs. Here's what you need to know about the most significant H-1B and F-1 visa changes in years.\n\n## 🚨 Critical Changes (Effective Immediately)\n\n### 1. Clearer Employer-Employee Relationship Standards\n\n**Before:** Murky guidelines that left startups vulnerable to denials\n**Now:** More definitive criteria for documenting startup responsibilities\n\n**What This Means for Founders:**\n- Easier to prove genuine specialized roles in your own company\n- Enhanced documentation framework for supervision structures  \n- Clearer path to demonstrate control vs employment distinction\n\n### 2. Updated Specialty Occupation Definitions\n\n**The Big Win:** Refined definition acknowledges modern tech roles\n\n**Easier Approval Paths For:**\n- Software development roles\n- Biotech research positions\n- Data science specializations\n- AI/ML engineering roles\n\n**Why This Matters:** Your startup role is more likely to qualify as \"specialty occupation\" under the new standards.\n\n### 3. Remote and Hybrid Work Flexibility\n\n**Game Changer:** Clarified compliance for modern work arrangements\n\n**Now Officially Supported:**\n- Remote worksites (your home office counts)\n- Co-working spaces (WeWork, etc.)\n- Third-party client locations\n- Hybrid startup environments\n\n**Translation:** Your lean startup doesn't need expensive office space to be H-1B compliant.\n\n### 4. F-1 Student Entrepreneurship Path\n\n**Incremental but Important Improvements:**\n- Better alignment of practical training (OPT) with startup goals\n- More predictable pathways for entity formation during studies\n- Clearer guidelines for fundraising activities on F-1 status\n\n## Real-World Impact for Immigrant Founders\n\n### Immediate Actions You Can Take\n\n**If You're Currently on H-1B:**\n1. Review your job description against new specialty occupation criteria\n2. Document your remote work compliance under new guidelines\n3. Strengthen employer-employee relationship documentation\n\n**If You're Planning Self-Sponsorship:**\n1. Use new frameworks to structure your role documentation\n2. Leverage clearer specialty occupation definitions\n3. Plan for remote/hybrid work arrangements from day one\n\n**If You're on F-1 Status:**\n1. Explore entrepreneurial OPT opportunities under new guidelines\n2. Plan entity formation timeline with updated compliance framework\n3. Consider startup activities that align with educational objectives\n\n## The Nuanced Reality\n\n### What This DOESN'T Solve\n- Still requires legitimate business need for your role\n- Prevailing wage requirements remain unchanged\n- Attorney guidance still essential for complex cases\n- Self-sponsorship still requires careful legal structuring\n\n### What This DOES Enable\n- More predictable regulatory environment\n- Reduced uncertainty for immigrant founders\n- Official acknowledgment of modern startup realities\n- Clearer pathways for legitimate entrepreneurship\n\n## Strategic Implications for 2025\n\n### For Existing Startups\nThis rule provides **regulatory confidence** to:\n- Hire H-1B employees with more certainty\n- Structure roles that align with new specialty occupation standards\n- Implement compliant remote work policies\n\n### For Aspiring Founders\nThis creates **clearer pathways** to:\n- Self-sponsor through properly structured startups\n- Transition from F-1 to entrepreneurial roles\n- Build businesses that align with immigration requirements\n\n## The Bigger Picture\n\nWhile not solving every challenge, these changes represent the most founder-friendly immigration policy shift in years. The government is finally acknowledging that immigrant entrepreneurs are:\n\n- **Job creators, not job takers**\n- **Innovation drivers in critical industries**  \n- **Essential to American economic competitiveness**\n\n## Action Items for H1BFounders Community\n\n1. **Review Current Status:** How do these changes affect your specific situation?\n2. **Update Documentation:** Align role descriptions with new specialty occupation criteria\n3. **Plan Strategically:** Use regulatory clarity to make bolder entrepreneurial moves\n4. **Stay Informed:** Immigration law continues evolving - community knowledge sharing is critical\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:** The path from visa dependency to entrepreneurial freedom just got clearer. Not easier, but more predictable - which is exactly what immigrant founders needed.\n\n*This isn't just policy change. It's permission to dream bigger.*\n\n---\n\n⚠️ **Legal Disclaimer:** This analysis is for educational purposes. Consult qualified immigration attorneys for case-specific guidance. Rules are complex and individual circumstances vary.\n\n📅 **Content Freshness:** Critical immigration information - valid until Dec 2025. Community will update as implementation details emerge.",

There's not a unique or special or additional struggle because you were the founder.\"**\n\n**Business Risks vs Immigration Risks:**\n- Standard startup failure rates apply\n- Immigration status tied to business success (additional layer)\n- **60-day grace period** still applies if company shuts down\n- Same rules as being laid off from any employer\n\n**Corporate Structure Protection:**\n- LLC limits personal liability for business debts\n- Proper entity formation separates business/personal finances\n- Immigration consequences independent of debt obligations\n\n### Salary Requirements & Flexibility **[88:01 - 137:00]**\n\n#### Paying Yourself Less **[91:01 - 114:00]**\n**\"If you're gonna get paid less, you have to do a change... file an amendment.\"**\n\n**The LCA Constraint:**\n- Must pay at least what you indicated on Labor Condition Application\n- Department of Labor prevailing wage = minimum floor\n- If you said $120K but prevailing wage is $100K, you're bound to $120K\n\n**Smart Solution: Part-Time Status**\n- File H1B amendment for part-time work\n- Maintain hourly wage compliance\n- Use time tracking apps for documentation\n- **\"Make sure you're keeping good records\"**\n\n#### Paying Yourself More **[116:01 - 130:00]**\n**\"It's totally fine. If you get paid more than you indicate, that's not an issue.\"**\n\n**No Amendment Needed For Increases:**\n- Can pay yourself above LCA amount\n- Better to take profits as distributions (tax benefits)\n- Only issue: if wage reveals your LCA calculation was wrong\n\n### The 51% Rule for Founders **[250:01 - 268:00]**\n**\"51 plus percent of my time is on this specialty occupation... they don't have a problem with [the other 49%].\"**\n\n**Government's Official Position:**\n- Majority time must be specialty occupation (software engineering, etc.)\n- Minority time can be founder duties (meetings, planning, fundraising)\n- Include job description with percentages in H1B petition\n- **\"Make it clear 51 plus percent of my time\"**\n\n**Real-World Application:**\n- Hired as \"Principal Engineer\" but introduce as \"Founder\"\n- 51%+ engineering work, 49% business development\n- Government explicitly addressed this in policy comments\n\n### Co-Founder Benefits **[142:01 - 172:00]**\n\n#### Immigration Advantages\n**Pre-January 17th:** Co-founder could be \"controller\" for employer-employee relationship\n**Post-January 17th:** \"That is not a question. It is irrelevant.\"\n\n#### Practical Benefits Still Remain:\n**Work Authorization Timing:**\n- Co-founder can publish apps before your H1B approved\n- **\"You can't build, develop, launch an app... unless you have work authorization\"**\n- Co-founder handles public-facing work until you're authorized\n\n**Smart Structure:**\n- Co-founder as President/Secretary (Delaware requirement)\n- You as majority shareholder/investor\n- Switch titles after H1B approval\n\n### Company Formation Timeline **[220:01 - 240:00]**\n**\"You could form the company on July 1st and file the H1B on July 10th.\"**\n\n**No Minimum Timeline Required:**\n- Can incorporate and file H1B within days\n- Need: FEIN, business plan, funding/revenue proof\n- **\"If you don't believe, then the government's never gonna believe\"**\n\n**Required Elements:**\n- Company exists with FEIN\n- Money in bank OR revenue generation plan\n- Legitimate business operations\n- Clear specialty occupation need\n\n## Advanced Strategies\n\n### H1B vs O1 Decision Matrix **[543:01 - 561:00]**\n\n#### H1B Advantages:\n- **Spouse can work** (H4 EAD if I-140 approved)\n- **Dual intent** (no travel restrictions during green card process)\n- Established, predictable process\n\n#### O1 Advantages:\n- **No salary requirements** (crucial for early startups)\n- **Broader work authorization** (field-based, not degree-restricted)\n- **Longer approval periods** (3 years vs 18 months for startup H1Bs)\n- **No lottery system**\n\n#### Decision Factors:\n**Choose H1B if:** Spouse needs to work, have relevant degree, can afford prevailing wage\n**Choose O1 if:** Early-stage startup, salary flexibility critical, field doesn't match degree\n\n### Green Card Strategy **[469:01 - 493:00]**\n**\"The pathway that people follow when they're doing this startup founder journey is gonna be similar to what Sid did... you're gonna do an EB1.\"**\n\n**Why Company-Sponsored Won't Work:**\n- PERM process requires genuine recruitment\n- Department of Labor won't believe unbiased hiring if you own 60%+\n- Successfully filed PERMs up to ~20% ownership max\n\n**Founder Green Card Path:**\n1. **EB1A (Extraordinary Ability)** - Self-petition\n2. **EB2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)** - Self-petition\n3. **Priority date portability** from existing EB2\n\n**Critical Insight:** Existing I-140 stays valid for H1B extensions and H4 EAD even after job change (if >6 months old).\n\n### Travel & Visa Stamping **[210:01 - 220:00]**\n**\"Every time you enter the US, what the officer is trying to confirm is you're actually doing what you say you're doing.\"**\n\n**Startup-Specific Risks:**\n- Officers less familiar with small companies\n- Higher chance of additional questioning\n- Carry documentation: pay stubs, company info, approval notices\n\n**Required Documents:**\n- Valid H1B approval notice\n- Recent pay stubs\n- Company letterhead with offer letter\n- Business information for officer verification\n\n## Success Rate Update **[454:01 - 469:00]**\n**\"Our experience has been positive... We filed cases with 100% owner and there's nobody else in the company... these cases were all being approved so far.\"**\n\n**6-Month Track Record (Jan-July 2025):**\n- Cases with 100% ownership approved\n- Single-person entities approved\n- $40K in bank + business plan sufficient\n- No significant decrease in approval rates\n\n**Attorney's Conservative Approach:**\n- Detailed documentation still recommended\n- Comprehensive business plans essential\n- Financial evidence critical for approval\n\n## Game-Changing Quotes\n\n### Legal Certainty\n**[32:01]** *\"You can form your own business that you 100% own and start working on that business.\"*\n\n### Paradigm Shift\n**[391:01]** *\"Post January 17th to 2025, you do not need to show employer-employee relationship.\"*\n\n### Practical Reality  \n**[233:01]** *\"If you don't believe, then the government's never gonna believe.\"*\n\n### Financial Flexibility\n**[105:01]** *\"The most common solution... is file an H1B amendment and knock your work down to part-time.\"*\n\n### Work Authorization\n**[163:01]** *\"The fundamental question the government cares about is not, are you being paid? It's, are you doing work?\"*\n\n---\n\n**Key Takeaway:** The January 17, 2025 rule changes eliminated the biggest barriers to H1B entrepreneurship. What was once complex and risky is now straightforward - if you know the rules.\n\n**Most Important Legal Insight:** *\"You do not require a board. You do not require somebody controlling your work in order to file an H1B, have it approved and work on your company.\"*\n\n---\n\n🎥 **[Watch Full 64:54 Legal Discussion →](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNdlH_ic4zM)**\n\n⚖️ **Legal Authority:** Raghavan Nagarajan, Partner at Serotte Law (20 years experience, 10+ years immigration)\n\n📧 **Connect:** rnagarajan@serottelaw.com | serottelaw.com\n\n⚠️ **Legal Disclaimer:** Attorney-client privilege does not exist for this public discussion.

I still have to maintain my H1B visa status i.e I lose my job, I get deported in 60 days. \n\nH1B - is a work based visa that makes you a US resident with zero safety net. On top, many on employment based visas believe they cannot start a company in the US until they receive their green cards. I am part of a few WhatsApp groups dedicated to this topic. \n\nIt cannot be more anti-American to curb and discourage entrepreneurial spirit amongst hard working group of legal immigrants. I have been through this. I hereby share this article to shed some light on the matter.\n\n---\n\n## What Happened Next\n\nThis simple post resonated with 873 people and sparked 54 conversations. It led to:\n\n- Creating the H1BFounders WhatsApp group\n- Building h1bfounders.com\n- Growing a community of 792+ immigrant founders\n- Proving that H1B holders CAN start companies\n\n## The Famous Line That Became Our Hook\n\n**\"I sponsored my own H1B Visa\"**\n\nThis became the rallying cry for our community - proving that with the right strategy, immigrant founders can take control of their destiny.\n\n## Community Origin Story\n\nFrom a LinkedIn post to a movement. What started as frustration became fuel. What began as isolation became community.\n\n**Welcome to H1BFounders. You're not alone anymore.**",

      "content": "# How to Add Board Members After Stripe Atlas (For Your Visa)\n\n*Someone asked this in WhatsApp. Here's the actual answer.*\n\n## The Problem\n\nYou use Stripe Atlas to incorporate. Great. But for O1 or H1B self-sponsorship, you need a proper board structure. Stripe Atlas only adds founders to the board by default.\n\nImmigration attorneys will tell you \"you can't control the company\" - that's incorrect information. You CAN own 100% of the company. You just need the right board structure.\n\n## The Real Rule\n\nFor O1 or H1B self-sponsorship:\n- You need an odd number of board members (typically 3)\n- You can't be the majority on the board\n- You CAN own 100% of the equity\n\nThink about it - USCIS doesn't want shell companies. They want real businesses. A real business has a board. That's it.\n\n## Super Easy to Do\n\nAfter Stripe Atlas incorporation:\n\n1. **Find 2 people to be board members**\n   - Any US citizen or green card holder\n   - Can be friends, advisors, other founders\n   - Don't overthink this\n\n2. **Amend your board**\n   - Draft a simple board resolution\n   - \"The board hereby appoints X and Y as directors\"\n   - That's literally it\n\n3. **Document it**\n   - Keep meeting minutes\n   - Show the board approved sponsoring your visa\n   - Done\n\n## What People Get Wrong\n\n\"I need to give up equity\" - No you don't. Board seats ≠ equity ownership.\n\n\"I need to pay board members\" - No you don't. Many serve for free or small equity (0.1%).\n\n\"This is complicated legal work\" - No it's not. It's one document.\n\n\"I need expensive lawyers\" - For the visa yes. For adding board members? You can do it yourself.\n\n## H1B vs O1 - Same Process\n\nBoth need the same thing:\n- Company sponsors your visa\n- You can't control the board that approves sponsorship\n- 3-person board where you're 1 vote = perfect\n\nThe rest is just paperwork.\n\n## Where to Find Board Members\n\nStop overthinking. Ask:\n- Other founders in this WhatsApp group\n- Former colleagues with green cards\n- Industry friends who want to help\n- Your accelerator mentors\n\nMost people say yes if you just ask. \"Hey, I need 2 board members for my visa. It's 4 meetings a year. Will you help?\"\n\n## The Actual Steps\n\n**Week 1**: Stripe Atlas incorporation\n**Week 2**: Text 5 people asking to be board members\n**Week 3**: Add them to board, document it\n**Week 4**: File your visa petition\n\nStop making this harder than it is.\n\n## Common Questions\n\n**Can I own 100% and still get the visa?**\nYes. Ownership and control are different. Own it all, just share board control.\n\n**What if board members leave later?**\nAfter you get your visa/green card, restructure however you want.\n\n**Do board members need to do anything?**\nShow up to 4 meetings a year (can be virtual). Sign documents saying they approve your visa sponsorship.\n\n**What if I already incorporated?**\nDoesn't matter. Add board members anytime. Today, tomorrow, whenever.\n\n## Real Examples\n\n**Me**: Added 2 board members, kept 100% equity, got my visa, later got green card. Still own everything.\n\n**Community member last month**: Solo founder, added his two friends to board, O1 approved in 60 days.\n\n**Another member**: Had co-founder already, added one more person, both got H1B transfers approved.\n\n## Resources\n\nTemplates? Google \"board resolution template\" - first result works.\n\nLawyers? Use them for the visa petition, not for adding board members.\n\nQuestions? Post in WhatsApp. Someone's done this before.\n\n## Action Items\n\n1. Stop reading guides\n2. Text potential board members right now\n3. Get this done this week\n4. Focus on building your business\n\nThe hardest part is actually having a business. Rest all is solvable.\n\n---\n\n*This is based on what actually works. Every week someone asks this same question in our WhatsApp. Now you have the answer.*\n\n*Questions? Tag @sid in WhatsApp*",

This is proven by Sid + Ercan's journey from idea to profitable company in under 2 years.\n\n## Key Insights with Timestamps\n\n### The Legal Reality **[30:01 - 32:15]**\n**\"Founding a company is absolutely legal on H1B. I've talked about this multiple times that friends in India have a company in US. So you don't even have to be in US to start an entity.\"**\n\n- You can start a US company from anywhere in the world\n- The issues start when you take paychecks/get on payroll\n- Leaving your employer changes your H1B status - that's where planning matters\n\n### Co-Founder Geography **[34:01 - 38:30]**\n**\"Does the co-founder have to be in the US? They don't. So here's an example right here.\"**\n\n**Ercan's Journey (Turkey → Canada → US):**\n- Applied for Canada PR from Turkey\n- Moved processing location to Europe for faster approval\n- Got Canadian PR in 2.5 years\n- Only needed Turkish passport to co-found US company\n- Planning TN visa route to US after Canadian citizenship\n\n### The Employer-Employee Relationship **[140:01 - 144:30]**\n**\"When you file your own H1B, the beneficiary needs to have an employer-employee relationship. That means [the company] needs to be able to fire the H1B person.\"**\n\n**Board Structure Solution:**\n- Can't have veto power in your own company\n- Need board majority that could outvote you\n- Board members don't need equity or salary\n- Can't put spouse on board (attorney advised)\n- Put independent friends/advisors instead\n\n### Financial Requirements **[122:01 - 131:00]**\n**\"They're looking to make sure the business is legit. You need to have a plan.\"**\n\n**What USCIS Wants to See:**\n- Ability to afford beneficiary salary for one year\n- Bank accounts, accounts receivable, or funding\n- Revenue-generating business with trade activity\n- Documentation that proves legitimate business need\n\n**Example:** Principal Engineer in Boston - need to show you can afford that prevailing wage.\n\n### Practical Business Stack **[84:01 - 89:00]**\n\n**Corporate Stack (Battle-Tested):**\n- **Delaware C-Corp** - Standard for H1B compliance\n- **Mercury Bank** - Startup-friendly banking\n- **Gusto** - Payroll/compliance ($30-40/month full-time)\n- **Puzzle.io** - AI-based accounting\n- **1099 contractors** - Easy for interns/part-time\n\n## The Co-Founder Chemistry **[212:01 - 235:00]**\n\n### How They Met\n**[214:01]** *The Authentication Crisis Story:*\n\"I found out that user management team was actually not even a team, it's one person... I was so shocked. How is it that a 20-year-old is owning like 15 microservices... and nobody got logged out, everything worked fine.\"\n\n### Founder Selection Criteria **[222:01 - 229:00]**\n**\"Look for somebody who can bet on themselves.

      "content": "# Introducing WIN CLUB: The C.O.D.E Framework\n\n**Or: How forcing functions create frameworks**\n\nTonight at 10 PM, I felt palm-sweating excitement.\n\nNot because I'm launching something. Because founders keep asking me to clarify my own thinking.\n\nThat's the double whammy.\n\n## The Forcing Function\n\nI started H1Founders to help people avoid the misinformation that plagued my visa journey. It remains a side project.\n\nFirst came the WhatsApp group. Q&A for 900+ founders navigating the visa maze.\n\nThen some walked further down the path. They needed 1:1 coaching. I helped 19 founders break through their limiting beliefs.\n\nOne of them asked for more: *\"I need a mentor to push me and hold me accountable.\"*\n\nThat became WIN CLUB. Private mentorship. Wed/Fri check-ins.\n\nI limited this first cohort to existing coaching clients. I don't want to scale this. I run a full-time startup myself.\n\nBut here's what's interesting: WIN CLUB forced the **C.O.D.E Framework** into existence.\n\nWithout WIN CLUB launching tomorrow, I wouldn't have systematized what I know. The framework wouldn't exist.\n\nThey're not just paying for my time. They're paying me to extract and crystallize the employee-to-founder journey.\n\n## The Problem Most Founders Have\n\nYou know what to do. You just refuse to win.\n\nYou hide behind:\n- Mediocre thinking\n- False limiting beliefs\n- Average expectations\n- Comfortable excuses\n\nI've coached 19 founders. Same pattern every time. The breakthrough isn't new information. It's breaking through the thinking that keeps you average.\n\n## The C.O.D.E Framework\n\nFour pillars. Twelve dimensions. Measured on a 1-10 scale.\n\n### **C = CREATE** (Technical Execution)\n1. **AI Coding Skill** - Can you ship with Claude/AI tools?\n2. **Systems Thinking** - Do you have daily systems or just goals?\n3. **Metrics Mastery** - Do you know your numbers?\n\n### **O = OWN** (Identity/Mindset)\n4. **Self-Accountability** - \"I own it\" vs \"circumstances messed me up\"\n5. **Decision Speed** - Analysis paralysis vs one-way door thinking\n6. **Learning Velocity** - How defensive are you to feedback?\n\n### **D = DRIVE** (Market/Revenue)\n7. **Market Understanding** - Do you understand economics and value?\n8. **Growth Execution** - Do you know CAC, LTV, channels?\n9. **Focus/Fail Fast** - Can you kill bad ideas or are you distracted?\n\n### **E = ENERGIZE** (Health/Foundation)\n10. **Physical Health** - Do you workout consistently?\n11. **Mental Practice** - Do you meditate or manage your mind?\n12. **Energy Management** - Can you sustain this for years?\n\n## Why Visual Proof Matters\n\nBack in 2022, I took Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain course.\n\nThe final deliverable was a \"BASB Snapshot\" - a radar chart showing 12 dimensions of my productivity system. Before vs After overlaid.\n\n**I went from 30% → 57%.**\n\nAlmost 2x growth. Undeniable. You could SEE the transformation.\n\nThat visual proof hit different than any testimonial could.\n\nThat's what I'm building for WIN CLUB.\n\nOctober 1: Baseline scores (1-10 on all 12 dimensions)\nMid-December: Final scores + radar chart\n\nThe transformation becomes visible. Not \"I feel better.\" But \"Look at this chart.\"\n\n## What Happens Tomorrow\n\nTomorrow afternoon, three sessions begin.\n\nThree founders. Twelve dimensions. Three months.\n\nI'll see potential in them higher than they see in themselves. I'll call out every excuse before they finish making it. I'll make sure they don't let mediocre thinking win.\n\nEach session gets recorded. I'll analyze patterns across all three. Extract what actually works.\n\nThis isn't about running a program. It's about systematizing the transformation from employee to founder.\n\n## The Test\n\nEvery framework needs validation.\n\nWill these three founders actually transform? Will the radar chart show real growth? Can I help them ship, make revenue, and own their decisions?\n\nI don't know yet.\n\nBut tomorrow afternoon, we start finding out.\n\nI'll share what happens.\n\n— Sid\n\n*PS: Q1 2026 cohort opens in December. If you want in, watch what happens with these three first.*",
