              The Fear Was Real
            </p>
            <p>
              "Don't start a business. You'll lose your H1B. Your family will be deported." 
              That voice in my head for <strong>15 years</strong>. Every entrepreneur in our community knows this fear.
            </p>

              But here's what I learned: <span className="font-semibold text-gray-900">The myths keeping immigrants 
              as employees are mostly BS.</span> You CAN start businesses on H1B. You CAN bootstrap profitable companies. 
              You CAN break free from visa slavery.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              I didn't just build one company - I built multiple. RenovateAI hit $3M revenue. I learned to bootstrap, 
              scale, and most importantly - how to help other immigrants overcome the mental blocks.

              100+ founders in our WhatsApp group within 24 hours. Everyone had the same fear. Everyone needed the same permission.
