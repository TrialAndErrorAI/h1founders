## CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Read These Files First
```bash
# Core philosophy and rules
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/CLAUDE.md

# Check current coaching data
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/data/coaching_crm.db

# Partnership strategy docs
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/docs/partners/

# WIN CLUB implementation
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/client/src/pages/win-club/coach.tsx
```

### 2. Partnership Strategy Pivot (30% Commission)
- Moving from fixed monthly fees to 30% commission
- OpenVenture: $25K O-1 service = $7.5K per conversion
- Let market decide between premium ($25K) and standard ($5-8K)
- "We help merit win, partners pay commission"

### 3. Immediate Priorities
1. **Coaching CRM Frontend** - 19 clients need management UI
2. **Commission Tracking** - For 30% partnership model
3. **WIN CLUB WhatsApp Group** - Pending creation
4. **Production Push** - 15 commits ahead, needs deployment

### 4. Dev Reminders
- **Theme compliance**: NEVER hardcode colors
- **Localhost auth**: Use dev mode bypass
- **Test with**: `npm run test:auth`
- **Deploy**: Git push = auto-deploy to production

### 5. Business Context
- WSJ feature driving traffic
- Merit > Lottery positioning resonates
- 860+ WhatsApp members ready for platform
- Coaching revenue model proven ($2,960 from 19 clients)

## NEXT SESSION START
```javascript
// 1. Check production metrics
firebase auth:list-users --limit 100

// 2. Review coaching CRM data
sqlite3 /Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/data/coaching_crm.db

// 3. Test WIN CLUB dashboard
http://localhost:5173/win-club/coach

// 4. Consider deployment
git status  // 15+ commits ahead
```

## Key Decisions Needed
1. Deploy to production? (WSJ momentum is NOW)
2. Build coaching CRM frontend or focus on partnerships?
3. Commission tracking system architecture?

## Remember the Mission
**Merit > Lottery | Builders > Beggars | Value > Visa Games**

We're not just breaking H1B myths. We're enabling the smartest people from anywhere to build in America based on MERIT, not lottery.
