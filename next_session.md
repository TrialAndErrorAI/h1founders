## üß† KEY DISCOVERIES FROM COACHING TRANSCRIPTS

### Permission-Seeking Patterns (The Problem):
- "How can I...?" - Begging to exist
- "My lawyer said..." - Outsourced thinking
- "I'll wait until 2029" - Accepting prison
- "Is it okay if..." - Permission addiction

### Identity Shift Patterns (The Solution):
- "I'm building this" - Already in motion
- "I tested it myself" - First-hand truth
- "Here's what works" - Authority position
- "I am a founder" - Identity complete

**Core Transformation**: "How can I?" ‚Üí "I am"
