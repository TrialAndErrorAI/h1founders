## üß† KEY INSIGHTS FROM PRD

**Sid's Real Mission**: Breaking mental slavery (self-imposed limitations)
- **Immigration is just one small prison** - Mental freedom is the bigger picture
- **"The hardest part is actually having a business"** - This is the core message
- **"The slave mentality was self-imposed"** - Hero section hook needed

**Authentic Voice Pattern**:
- **"That's a common myth"** then gives REAL answer - classic Sid
- **Direct, myth-busting, no fake urgency** - shares real struggle
- **Frustrated with misinformation** - calls it out directly
- **Business-first philosophy** - revenue and customers matter more than paperwork

**Voice Transformation Needed**:
- Remove ALL marketing speak and fake urgency
- Add mental freedom hooks throughout
- Sound like WhatsApp Sid (direct, helpful, slightly frustrated)
- Every section should bust a myth explicitly

## üí° KEY TECHNICAL INSIGHTS

### Theme Implementation Pattern (Critical Fix)
```css
/* WRONG - Hardcoded colors break theming */
<div className="bg-black text-white">

/* RIGHT - Use CSS variables for dynamic theming */
<div style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--bg-primary)', color: 'var(--text-primary)' }}>
```

### CSS Variable Inheritance (Must Have Defaults)
```css
/* Add to :root not just :root[data-theme="light"] */
:root,
:root[data-theme="light"] {
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-primary: #111827;
  /* Light mode defaults prevent blank screens */
}
```

### Theme Context Pattern
```typescript
const ThemeContext = createContext<ThemeContextType | undefined>(undefined)
export type ThemeMode = 'light' | 'dark' | 'matrix'

// LocalStorage persistence
useEffect(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem('h1founders-theme') as ThemeMode
  if (saved) setThemeState(saved)
}, [])
