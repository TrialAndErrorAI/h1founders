# Session State - H1Founders @ 5:59 PM

## Status: Partnership strategy pivot - considering 30% commission model even for overpriced services

## Current Focus
Discussing OpenVenture Capital $25K O-1 service - if they pay 30% commission ($7.5K), why not list them?

## Completed This Session
- ✅ H1 Founders Network Community created and live
- ✅ Manisha added to community for testing
- ✅ WhatsApp rate limit discovered (2-3 hour wait)
- ✅ Coached Manisha on asset creation vs disposable messages
- ✅ Identified OpenVenture as potential "premium option" partner

## Blocked/Pending
- WhatsApp rate limit - check again at 7-8 PM to add groups
- H1B Founders group not yet linked (waiting)
- WIN CLUB group creation pending
- Ahmed (Deel) response on immigration partnership

## NEXT ACTION (CRITICAL)
"When you wake, START HERE: Check WhatsApp rate limit at 7-8 PM. If cleared, link H1B Founders group and create WIN CLUB. Also finalize partnership strategy - if predatory firms pay 30% commission, list them as 'premium' alongside fair $5K options. Let members choose."

## Open Threads
- **Partnership Philosophy Shift**: List ALL partners if they pay commission - premium ($25K) and standard ($5-8K) side by side
- Manisha wants to pursue OpenVenture despite 5x pricing
- Community migration announcement ready to send
- Frontend for coaching CRM still needed

## Key Context
- **New Insight**: If OpenVenture pays $7.5K per conversion (30% of $25K), why refuse? List them as "Premium White Glove" next to standard options
- **Manisha Logic**: "3 people paid $25K so it must be good" - social proof fallacy
- **WhatsApp Model**: Community has separate member list from groups
- **Manifest Dead**: Killed after CEO power play

## Partnership Strategy Evolution
**Old**: Only partner with fair-priced firms
**New**: Accept ALL paying partners, create tiers:
- Premium O-1: $25K (OpenVenture)
- Standard O-1: $5-8K (others)
- Let market decide, we get paid either way
