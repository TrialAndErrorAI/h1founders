# Session State - H1Founders @ End of Sept 27, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ STATUS: v0.8.1 Live, 33 Users, Coaching Platform Architecture Defined

## What We Shipped (Sept 27 Session #2)
âœ… **Changelog System Refactor** - Made internal-only with auto-reminders
âœ… **Pre-push Hook Enhanced** - Now prompts for changelog updates
âœ… **MDX Decision Made** - Rejected for simpler React component approach
âœ… **RFC 008 Enhanced** - Added video intelligence layer foundation
âœ… **User Growth** - 31 â†’ 33 users (slow but steady WSJ traction)

## Technical Decisions Made

### 1. Changelog â†’ Internal Only
- Removed public `/changelog` route and component (-108 lines of bloat)
- Kept single `/CHANGELOG.md` as internal documentation
- Added pre-push hook reminder: "Have you updated /CHANGELOG.md?"
- Rationale: Eliminates maintenance burden while keeping history

### 2. MDX Exploration â†’ Rejected
- **Considered**: MDX for embedding React components in content
- **Decision**: Keep simple markdown + React components separately
- **Rationale**: Our workflow (Substack â†’ Platform) doesn't benefit from MDX
- **Alternative**: Build dedicated React pages for interactive content

### 3. Video Intelligence Architecture
Enhanced RFC 008 with reusable video player foundation:
```typescript
interface IntelligentVideoPlayer {
  synchronizedTranscript: TranscriptSegment[];
  askAI: (question: string) => AIResponse;  // "Ask NEXUS"
  keyMoments: AIExtractedMoment[];
  search: VideoSearchCapability;
}
```
This becomes the foundation for WIN CLUB and all future video content.

## Current Platform State
- **Users**: 33 real signups (growth from 31 yesterday)
- **WhatsApp**: 900+ members in H1 Founders Network (Community structure)
- **Coaching**: 19 clients, $2,960 revenue (backend operational, needs frontend)
- **WIN CLUB**: Dashboard operational, ready for video intelligence layer
- **Version**: v0.8.1 (Community Edition)
- **Branch**: master (feat/mdx created but abandoned after decision)

### 2. Partnership Strategy Pivot (30% Commission)
- Moving from fixed monthly fees to 30% commission
- OpenVenture: $25K O-1 service = $7.5K per conversion
- Let market decide between premium ($25K) and standard ($5-8K)
- "We help merit win, partners pay commission"

### 3. Immediate Priorities
1. **Partnership Pitch with WSJ Credibility** - Update with media coverage proof
2. **Coaching CRM Frontend** - 19 clients need management UI
3. **Commission Tracking** - For 30% partnership model
4. **WIN CLUB WhatsApp Group** - Create community for cohort
5. **Content Expansion** - Leverage WSJ coverage for authority

### 4. Dev Reminders
- **Theme compliance**: NEVER hardcode colors
- **Localhost auth**: Use dev mode bypass
- **Test with**: `npm run test:auth`
- **Deploy**: Git push = auto-deploy to production

### 5. Business Context
- WSJ feature driving traffic (Article live September 26)
- Merit > Lottery positioning resonates strongly
- 900+ members in H1 Founders Network (WhatsApp Community)
- Coaching revenue model proven ($2,960 from 19 clients)
- Community structure: Upgraded from Groups to WhatsApp Communities
- New join link active: https://chat.whatsapp.com/L7sHBIbCuyx2cYvzuaDCat

## NEXT SESSION START

// 2. Review coaching CRM data

// 3. Test WIN CLUB dashboard
http://localhost:5173/win-club/coach

// 4. Check deployment status
git status  // v0.8.1 deployed, production live
```

## Key Decisions Needed
1. Build coaching CRM frontend next or partnership pitch deck?
2. Commission tracking system architecture?
3. WIN CLUB WhatsApp group structure (Community vs Group)?
4. Content strategy to leverage WSJ coverage?
