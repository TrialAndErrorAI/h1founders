## üêõ DEBUGGING REMINDERS

From Pragmatic Programming Philosophy:

### Core Principles
- **Fix the problem, not the blame** - Focus on understanding the actual issue
- **Don't assume it - prove it** - Verify every assumption with data
- **"select" isn't broken** - The bug is probably in your code, not the platform
- **Find root causes** - Not just symptoms of the problem

### Debugging Process
1. **Start with accurate data** - Check actual logs/responses
2. **Make bugs reproducible** - Ideally with a single command
3. **Use tracer bullets** - Get end-to-end working first, then enhance
4. **Process of elimination** - Your code first, then libraries, OS last

### Testing Strategy
- **Run the code** before going too far with changes
- **Test on mobile** (significant traffic expected from mobile)
- **Verify deployment** after changes
- **Check bundle size** impact with each feature

## üöÄ QUICK START COMMANDS

### Test Current Platform
```bash
cd /Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders

# Check git status
git status

# Start development
cd client && bun run dev

# Build and check bundle size
bun run build
ls -la dist/ | grep -E "\\.js|\\.css"

# View live site
open https://master.h1founders.pages.dev
```

### Verify Functionality
```bash
# Test all routes work
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/tools
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/resources
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/stories
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/events
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/network
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/academy
```

### Test Authentication Flow
```bash
# 1. Start development server
cd /Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/client && bun run dev

# 2. Navigate to Network section 
open http://localhost:5173/network

# 3. Test phone auth with test number
# Phone: +15555555555
# Code: 000000

# 4. Verify auth state persists on page reload

# 5. Check Firestore for user creation
# Visit Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/h1founders
```

### Next Critical Tasks
```bash
# 1. Import WhatsApp members to Firestore
# Create script to populate 781 member profiles

# 2. Build member directory UI
# Display authenticated user's directory

# 3. Implement code splitting
# Reduce 1.27MB bundle size urgently
```

## üìä PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Completed**: Foundation + Tools + Resources + Stories + Events + **AUTHENTICATION** (95% of core platform)  
**Current State**: Firebase Phone Auth fully operational, Network section unlocked  
**Next Critical**: Import 781 WhatsApp members + Bundle size optimization  
**Timeline**: Ready for member directory population, 1 week to full import
