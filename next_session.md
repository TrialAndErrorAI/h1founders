## CRITICAL CONTEXT FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. Read These Files First
```bash
# Core philosophy and rules
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/CLAUDE.md

# Check current coaching data
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/data/coaching_crm.db

# Partnership strategy docs
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/docs/partners/

# WIN CLUB implementation
/Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/client/src/pages/win-club/coach.tsx
```

### 2. Partnership Strategy Pivot (30% Commission)
- Moving from fixed monthly fees to 30% commission
- OpenVenture: $25K O-1 service = $7.5K per conversion
- Let market decide between premium ($25K) and standard ($5-8K)
- "We help merit win, partners pay commission"

### 3. Immediate Priorities
1. **Partnership Pitch with WSJ Credibility** - Update with media coverage proof
2. **Coaching CRM Frontend** - 19 clients need management UI
3. **Commission Tracking** - For 30% partnership model
4. **WIN CLUB WhatsApp Group** - Create community for cohort
5. **Content Expansion** - Leverage WSJ coverage for authority

### 4. Dev Reminders
- **Theme compliance**: NEVER hardcode colors
- **Localhost auth**: Use dev mode bypass
- **Test with**: `npm run test:auth`
- **Deploy**: Git push = auto-deploy to production

### 5. Business Context
- WSJ feature driving traffic (Article live September 26)
- Merit > Lottery positioning resonates strongly
- 900+ members in H1 Founders Network (WhatsApp Community)
- Coaching revenue model proven ($2,960 from 19 clients)
- Community structure: Upgraded from Groups to WhatsApp Communities

// 3. Test WIN CLUB dashboard

// 4. Check deployment status
git status  // v0.8.1 deployed, production live
```

## Key Decisions Needed
1. Build coaching CRM frontend next or partnership pitch deck?

4. Content strategy to leverage WSJ coverage?
