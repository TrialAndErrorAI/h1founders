   - Video/text content delivery
   - Progress tracking
   - Member-only access

## 🔑 KEY DECISIONS MADE

### Authentication Strategy
- **Firebase Auth** over Cloudflare Workers (proven at scale, phone auth built-in)
- **Phone-first** for WhatsApp members (SMS/WhatsApp OTP)
- **Email-second** for Substack subscribers (magic links)
- **Pre-populate and claim** approach for existing 1,400+ members

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + TypeScript
- **Package Manager**: Bun (faster than npm)
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare Pages (auto-deploy from master)
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (when auth implemented)
- **Current Storage**: localStorage (temporary)

### Design System
- **Matrix Theme**: Black (#0d0208), Matrix green (#00ff41), Red pill CTAs (#ff073a)
- **Typography**: JetBrains Mono for terminal feel
- **Animations**: Typing effects, glow on hover
- **Patterns**: Terminal prompts, function-style CTAs, code comments

## 🛠 TECHNICAL CONTEXT

### Stack Details
```json
{
  "framework": "React 19.1.0",
  "bundler": "Vite 6.3.5",
  "routing": "React Router DOM 7.8.2",
  "styling": "Tailwind CSS 4.1.13",

### Known Issues
1. **Bundle Size**: 627KB (target: <300KB)
2. **No Backend**: Using localStorage for persistence
3. **Mock Data**: All content is sample/demo data
4. **No Auth**: Network section locked but not functional
5. **No SEO**: Missing meta tags and optimization

### Development Commands
```bash
# Start development server
cd /Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders/client
bun run dev

# Build for production
bun run build

# Preview production build
bun run preview

# Deploy (auto on git push to master)
git push origin master
```

## 🐛 DEBUGGING REMINDERS

From Pragmatic Programming Philosophy:

### Core Principles
- **Fix the problem, not the blame** - Focus on understanding the actual issue
- **Don't assume it - prove it** - Verify every assumption with data
- **"select" isn't broken** - The bug is probably in your code, not the platform
- **Find root causes** - Not just symptoms of the problem

### Debugging Process
1. **Start with accurate data** - Check actual logs/responses
2. **Make bugs reproducible** - Ideally with a single command
3. **Use tracer bullets** - Get end-to-end working first, then enhance
4. **Process of elimination** - Your code first, then libraries, OS last

### Testing Strategy
- **Run the code** before going too far with changes
- **Test on mobile** (significant traffic expected from mobile)
- **Verify deployment** after changes
- **Check bundle size** impact with each feature

## 🚀 QUICK START COMMANDS

### Test Current Platform
```bash
cd /Users/sid/Code/te/h1founders

# Check git status
git status

# Start development
cd client && bun run dev

# Build and check bundle size
bun run build
ls -la dist/ | grep -E "\\.js|\\.css"

# View live site
open https://master.h1founders.pages.dev
```

### Verify Functionality
```bash
# Test all routes work
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/tools
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/resources
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/stories
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/events
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/network
curl -I https://master.h1founders.pages.dev/academy
```

### Next Implementation Start
```bash
# 1. Read RFC-006 for Firebase auth strategy
cat docs/rfc006_member_directory_auth.md

# 2. Install Firebase
cd client && bun add firebase

# 3. Set up Firebase config
# (Follow RFC-006 implementation checklist)
```

## 📊 PROGRESS SUMMARY

**Completed**: Foundation + Tools + Resources + Stories + Events (80% of core platform)  
**Next Critical**: Authentication system to unlock Network section  
**Timeline**: 2 weeks to Firebase auth MVP, 4 weeks to full member directory  
**Community Impact**: Connecting 1,400+ existing members to unified platform  

## 💡 SUCCESS PATTERNS

**What's Working:**
- Matrix theme creates strong brand consistency
- Interactive tools provide immediate value
- Real community stats build credibility
- Mobile-first approach for WhatsApp audience
- Fast development with Bun + Vite

**Key Insights:**
- Phone auth is critical for WhatsApp-first community
- Pre-populating directory creates instant social proof
- One-click claiming reduces friction for existing members
- OG badges reward early community members
