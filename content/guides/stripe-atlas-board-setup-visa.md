# How to Add Board Members After Stripe Atlas (For Your Visa)

*Someone asked this in WhatsApp. Here's the actual answer.*

## The Problem

You use Stripe Atlas to incorporate. Great. But for O1 or H1B self-sponsorship, you need a proper board structure. Stripe Atlas only adds founders to the board by default.

Immigration attorneys will tell you "you can't control the company" - that's incorrect information. You CAN own 100% of the company. You just need the right board structure.

## The Real Rule

For O1 or H1B self-sponsorship:
- You need an odd number of board members (typically 3)
- You can't be the majority on the board
- You CAN own 100% of the equity

Think about it - USCIS doesn't want shell companies. They want real businesses. A real business has a board. That's it.

## Super Easy to Do

After Stripe Atlas incorporation:

1. **Find 2 people to be board members**
   - Any US citizen or green card holder
   - Can be friends, advisors, other founders
   - Don't overthink this

2. **Amend your board**
   - Draft a simple board resolution
   - "The board hereby appoints X and Y as directors"
   - That's literally it

3. **Document it**
   - Keep meeting minutes
   - Show the board approved sponsoring your visa
   - Done

## What People Get Wrong

"I need to give up equity" - No you don't. Board seats â‰  equity ownership.

"I need to pay board members" - No you don't. Many serve for free or small equity (0.1%).

"This is complicated legal work" - No it's not. It's one document.

"I need expensive lawyers" - For the visa yes. For adding board members? You can do it yourself.

## H1B vs O1 - Same Process

Both need the same thing:
- Company sponsors your visa
- You can't control the board that approves sponsorship
- 3-person board where you're 1 vote = perfect

The rest is just paperwork.

## Where to Find Board Members

Stop overthinking. Ask:
- Other founders in this WhatsApp group
- Former colleagues with green cards
- Industry friends who want to help
- Your accelerator mentors

Most people say yes if you just ask. "Hey, I need 2 board members for my visa. It's 4 meetings a year. Will you help?"

## The Actual Steps

**Week 1**: Stripe Atlas incorporation
**Week 2**: Text 5 people asking to be board members
**Week 3**: Add them to board, document it
**Week 4**: File your visa petition

Stop making this harder than it is.

## Common Questions

**Can I own 100% and still get the visa?**
Yes. Ownership and control are different. Own it all, just share board control.

**What if board members leave later?**
After you get your visa/green card, restructure however you want.

**Do board members need to do anything?**
Show up to 4 meetings a year (can be virtual). Sign documents saying they approve your visa sponsorship.

**What if I already incorporated?**
Doesn't matter. Add board members anytime. Today, tomorrow, whenever.

## Real Examples

**Me**: Added 2 board members, kept 100% equity, got my visa, later got green card. Still own everything.

**Community member last month**: Solo founder, added his two friends to board, O1 approved in 60 days.

**Another member**: Had co-founder already, added one more person, both got H1B transfers approved.

## Resources

Templates? Google "board resolution template" - first result works.

Lawyers? Use them for the visa petition, not for adding board members.

Questions? Post in WhatsApp. Someone's done this before.

## Action Items

1. Stop reading guides
2. Text potential board members right now
3. Get this done this week
4. Focus on building your business

The hardest part is actually having a business. Rest all is solvable.
