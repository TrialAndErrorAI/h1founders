# Founding a Company is Absolutely Legal on H1B
*Live Call with Co-Founder Ercan - September 24, 2024*

**The definitive guide to starting your company while on H1B visa, featuring real co-founder insights, full transcript, and battle-tested strategies.**

## üéØ The Core Truth

**[30:01] "Founding a company is absolutely legal on H1B."**

This isn't theory. This is proven by Sid + Ercan's journey from idea to profitable company in under 2 years.

## Key Insights with Timestamps

### The Legal Reality **[30:01 - 32:15]**
**"Founding a company is absolutely legal on H1B. I've talked about this multiple times that friends in India have a company in US. So you don't even have to be in US to start an entity."**

- You can start a US company from anywhere in the world
- The issues start when you take paychecks/get on payroll
- Leaving your employer changes your H1B status - that's where planning matters

### Co-Founder Geography **[34:01 - 38:30]**
**"Does the co-founder have to be in the US? They don't. So here's an example right here."**

**Ercan's Journey (Turkey ‚Üí Canada ‚Üí US):**
- Applied for Canada PR from Turkey
- Moved processing location to Europe for faster approval
- Got Canadian PR in 2.5 years
- Only needed Turkish passport to co-found US company
- Planning TN visa route to US after Canadian citizenship

### The Employer-Employee Relationship **[140:01 - 144:30]**
**"When you file your own H1B, the beneficiary needs to have an employer-employee relationship. That means [the company] needs to be able to fire the H1B person."**

**Board Structure Solution:**
- Can't have veto power in your own company
- Need board majority that could outvote you
- Board members don't need equity or salary
- Can't put spouse on board (attorney advised)
- Put independent friends/advisors instead

### Financial Requirements **[122:01 - 131:00]**
**"They're looking to make sure the business is legit. You need to have a plan."**

**What USCIS Wants to See:**
- Ability to afford beneficiary salary for one year
- Bank accounts, accounts receivable, or funding
- Revenue-generating business with trade activity
- Documentation that proves legitimate business need

**Example:** Principal Engineer in Boston - need to show you can afford that prevailing wage.

### Practical Business Stack **[84:01 - 89:00]**

**Corporate Stack (Battle-Tested):**
- **Delaware C-Corp** - Standard for H1B compliance
- **Mercury Bank** - Startup-friendly banking
- **Gusto** - Payroll/compliance ($30-40/month full-time)
- **Puzzle.io** - AI-based accounting
- **1099 contractors** - Easy for interns/part-time

## The Co-Founder Chemistry **[212:01 - 235:00]**

### How They Met
**[214:01]** *The Authentication Crisis Story:*
"I found out that user management team was actually not even a team, it's one person... I was so shocked. How is it that a 20-year-old is owning like 15 microservices... and nobody got logged out, everything worked fine."

### Founder Selection Criteria **[222:01 - 229:00]**
**"Look for somebody who can bet on themselves. That's the criteria."**

**The $100K Test:**
"If I had $100,000, would I give that money to myself in my own company? Would I make that investment vs giving it to a different company for 10x returns?"

**Chemistry Factors:**
- Long-term commitment ("like a marriage")
- Complementary skills (business + engineering)
- Organic relationship development
- Shared vision and work ethic

## Revenue Generation Reality **[242:01 - 253:00]**

### The Distribution Challenge
**"Consumer focused, it's very hard to bootstrap... Distribution is a key challenge."**

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Formula:**
- Match revenue with acquisition cost first
- Optimize ads, channels, customer segments
- Data-driven approach to scaling
- Bootstrap validation before VC funding

### The Bootstrap Timeline
**[90:01 - 95:00]** "It took us about a year to get to a point where I could afford my salary for my business."

**The Goal:** Generate enough monthly profit to cover founder salaries, then make the switch.

## Advanced Visa Strategies

### Alternative Pathways **[70:01 - 82:00]**
**O1 vs H1B Trade-offs:**
- **O1**: No salary cap, no lottery, extraordinary skills required
- **H1B**: Salary requirements, lottery system, but more predictable
- **TN Visa**: Available for Canadian citizens (Ercan's planned route)

### The Self-Sponsorship Reality **[194:01 - 204:00]**
**"Self-sponsor is a wrong word... The petitioner is the company. Company is a legal entity."**

**Mental Model:** Think of your company as a completely separate entity that happens to sponsor you - because legally, that's exactly what it is.

## Action Framework

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Delaware C-Corp** setup
2. **Mercury banking** account  
3. **Gusto payroll** system
4. **Board structure** planning
