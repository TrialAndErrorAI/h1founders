# The Post That Started H1BFounders

I have been in the US for 15 years. I still have to maintain my H1B visa status i.e I lose my job, I get deported in 60 days. 

H1B - is a work based visa that makes you a US resident with zero safety net. On top, many on employment based visas believe they cannot start a company in the US until they receive their green cards. I am part of a few WhatsApp groups dedicated to this topic. 

It cannot be more anti-American to curb and discourage entrepreneurial spirit amongst hard working group of legal immigrants. I have been through this. I hereby share this article to shed some light on the matter.
