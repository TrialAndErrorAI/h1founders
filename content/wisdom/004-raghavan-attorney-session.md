# Navigating Immigration Law: Live Q&A with Attorney Raghavan Nagarajan
*July 14, 2025 - Post-January 17th Rule Changes*

**The definitive legal authority on H1B entrepreneurship, featuring immigration attorney insights on the game-changing January 17, 2025 policy updates.**

## üö® Breaking: January 17, 2025 Rule Changes Everything

### The Paradigm Shift **[19:01 - 21:30]**
**"Post January 17th, 2025, you do not need to show employer-employee relationship."**

**Before January 17th:**
- Complex board structures required
- "Right to control" documentation critical
- Co-founder control arrangements necessary
- Employer-employee relationship proof mandatory

**After January 17th:**
- ‚úÖ **No board required**
- ‚úÖ **No employer-employee relationship proof**
- ‚úÖ **100% ownership allowed**
- ‚úÖ **Single-person entities viable**

### Why This Changes Everything **[397:01 - 403:30]**
**"The previous paradigm, we would always say the company controls your work... In the current paradigm, they have specifically said right to control is not an issue."**

## Core Legal Questions Answered

### Can H1B Holders Start Companies? **[32:01 - 38:00]**
**Attorney Raghavan:** *"Yes. In probably all of the different ways and guises and forms that a US citizen or a green card holder could."*

**What You CAN Do:**
- Form 100% owned business
- Develop products while on H1B status
- Invest in other startups
- Take all actions a citizen could take

**What Requires Process:**
- Obtaining specific work authorization through H1B program
- Following proper filing procedures
- Meeting specialty occupation requirements

### Startup Failure & Immigration Risk **[40:01 - 52:00]**
**"From the final date of your actual employment, you enter a 60 day grace period... There's not a unique or special or additional struggle because you were the founder."**

**Business Risks vs Immigration Risks:**
- Standard startup failure rates apply
- Immigration status tied to business success (additional layer)
- **60-day grace period** still applies if company shuts down
- Same rules as being laid off from any employer

**Corporate Structure Protection:**
- LLC limits personal liability for business debts
- Proper entity formation separates business/personal finances
- Immigration consequences independent of debt obligations

### Salary Requirements & Flexibility **[88:01 - 137:00]**

#### Paying Yourself Less **[91:01 - 114:00]**
**"If you're gonna get paid less, you have to do a change... file an amendment."**

**The LCA Constraint:**
- Must pay at least what you indicated on Labor Condition Application
- Department of Labor prevailing wage = minimum floor
- If you said $120K but prevailing wage is $100K, you're bound to $120K

**Smart Solution: Part-Time Status**
- File H1B amendment for part-time work
- Maintain hourly wage compliance
- Use time tracking apps for documentation
- **"Make sure you're keeping good records"**

#### Paying Yourself More **[116:01 - 130:00]**
**"It's totally fine. If you get paid more than you indicate, that's not an issue."**

**No Amendment Needed For Increases:**
- Can pay yourself above LCA amount
- Better to take profits as distributions (tax benefits)
- Only issue: if wage reveals your LCA calculation was wrong

### The 51% Rule for Founders **[250:01 - 268:00]**
**"51 plus percent of my time is on this specialty occupation... they don't have a problem with [the other 49%]."**

**Government's Official Position:**
- Majority time must be specialty occupation (software engineering, etc.)
- Minority time can be founder duties (meetings, planning, fundraising)
- Include job description with percentages in H1B petition
- **"Make it clear 51 plus percent of my time"**

**Real-World Application:**
- Hired as "Principal Engineer" but introduce as "Founder"
- 51%+ engineering work, 49% business development
- Government explicitly addressed this in policy comments

### Co-Founder Benefits **[142:01 - 172:00]**

#### Immigration Advantages
**Pre-January 17th:** Co-founder could be "controller" for employer-employee relationship
**Post-January 17th:** "That is not a question. It is irrelevant."

#### Practical Benefits Still Remain:
**Work Authorization Timing:**
- Co-founder can publish apps before your H1B approved
- **"You can't build, develop, launch an app... unless you have work authorization"**
- Co-founder handles public-facing work until you're authorized

**Smart Structure:**
- Co-founder as President/Secretary (Delaware requirement)
- You as majority shareholder/investor
- Switch titles after H1B approval

### Company Formation Timeline **[220:01 - 240:00]**
**"You could form the company on July 1st and file the H1B on July 10th."**

**No Minimum Timeline Required:**
- Can incorporate and file H1B within days
- Need: FEIN, business plan, funding/revenue proof
- **"If you don't believe, then the government's never gonna believe"**

**Required Elements:**
- Company exists with FEIN
- Money in bank OR revenue generation plan
- Legitimate business operations
- Clear specialty occupation need

## Advanced Strategies

### H1B vs O1 Decision Matrix **[543:01 - 561:00]**

#### H1B Advantages:
- **Spouse can work** (H4 EAD if I-140 approved)
- **Dual intent** (no travel restrictions during green card process)
- Established, predictable process

#### O1 Advantages:
- **No salary requirements** (crucial for early startups)
- **Broader work authorization** (field-based, not degree-restricted)
- **Longer approval periods** (3 years vs 18 months for startup H1Bs)
- **No lottery system**

#### Decision Factors:
**Choose H1B if:** Spouse needs to work, have relevant degree, can afford prevailing wage
**Choose O1 if:** Early-stage startup, salary flexibility critical, field doesn't match degree

### Green Card Strategy **[469:01 - 493:00]**
**"The pathway that people follow when they're doing this startup founder journey is gonna be similar to what Sid did... you're gonna do an EB1."**

**Why Company-Sponsored Won't Work:**
- PERM process requires genuine recruitment
- Department of Labor won't believe unbiased hiring if you own 60%+
- Successfully filed PERMs up to ~20% ownership max

**Founder Green Card Path:**
1. **EB1A (Extraordinary Ability)** - Self-petition
2. **EB2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)** - Self-petition
3. **Priority date portability** from existing EB2

**Critical Insight:** Existing I-140 stays valid for H1B extensions and H4 EAD even after job change (if >6 months old).

### Travel & Visa Stamping **[210:01 - 220:00]**
**"Every time you enter the US, what the officer is trying to confirm is you're actually doing what you say you're doing."**

**Startup-Specific Risks:**
- Officers less familiar with small companies
- Higher chance of additional questioning
- Carry documentation: pay stubs, company info, approval notices

**Required Documents:**
- Valid H1B approval notice
- Recent pay stubs
- Company letterhead with offer letter
- Business information for officer verification

## Success Rate Update **[454:01 - 469:00]**
**"Our experience has been positive... We filed cases with 100% owner and there's nobody else in the company... these cases were all being approved so far."**

**6-Month Track Record (Jan-July 2025):**
- Cases with 100% ownership approved
- Single-person entities approved
- $40K in bank + business plan sufficient
- No significant decrease in approval rates

**Attorney's Conservative Approach:**
- Detailed documentation still recommended
- Comprehensive business plans essential
- Financial evidence critical for approval

## Game-Changing Quotes

### Legal Certainty
**[32:01]** *"You can form your own business that you 100% own and start working on that business."*

### Paradigm Shift
**[391:01]** *"Post January 17th to 2025, you do not need to show employer-employee relationship."*

### Practical Reality  
**[233:01]** *"If you don't believe, then the government's never gonna believe."*

### Financial Flexibility
**[105:01]** *"The most common solution... is file an H1B amendment and knock your work down to part-time."*

### Work Authorization
**[163:01]** *"The fundamental question the government cares about is not, are you being paid? It's, are you doing work?"*

---

**Key Takeaway:** The January 17, 2025 rule changes eliminated the biggest barriers to H1B entrepreneurship. What was once complex and risky is now straightforward - if you know the rules.

**Most Important Legal Insight:** *"You do not require a board. You do not require somebody controlling your work in order to file an H1B, have it approved and work on your company."*
