# Trump's $100K H1B Proclamation: What It Actually Means (Stop Panicking)

*September 19, 2025 - 8:00 PM ET*

I'm watching our WhatsApp group explode with panic right now. Let me break down what this proclamation ACTUALLY says, not what lawyers want you to fear.

## The Actual Facts

Trump just signed a proclamation requiring a $100,000 payment for H1B petitions. It goes into effect September 21, 2025 (this Sunday) for 12 months.

But here's what everyone's missing:

## Who This ACTUALLY Affects

**READ Section 1(b) and 3(a) carefully:**

The $100K requirement applies to "H-1B specialty occupation workers...who are **currently outside the United States**" and "aliens who **enter or attempt to enter** the United States."

### You're NOT Affected If:
- ✅ **H1B Transfer** - You're already in the US changing employers
- ✅ **H1B Extension** - You're extending your current H1B
- ✅ **F1 to H1B** - You're changing status while in the US
- ✅ **Self-Sponsorship** - You're already here starting your company
- ✅ **Currently in US** - You're not leaving the country

### You ARE Affected If:
- ❌ **New H1B from abroad** - Company trying to bring you from India/elsewhere
- ❌ **Outsourcing companies** - Infosys, TCS, Wipro bringing consultants
- ❌ **First-time H1B** - You're outside US trying to come in

## The Big Unknown: Re-entry

**Critical question:** If you leave the US to visit family, can you come back without paying $100K?

The proclamation is ambiguous. It says "enter or attempt to enter" but also talks about "petitions accompanied by payment." You don't file a petition to re-enter with a valid visa.

**My interpretation:** Re-entry with valid visa should be fine. But I wouldn't travel until we get clarification.

## Why This Is Actually Good for You

If you're an H1B holder already in the US, this proclamation just made you MORE valuable:

1. **Your replacement costs $100K more** - Companies can't just replace you with cheaper labor
2. **Outsourcing firms are dead** - They can't pay $100K per consultant
3. **Your negotiating power increased** - You're now expensive to replace
4. **Self-sponsorship unchanged** - You can still start your company

## Legal Reality Check

Let's be clear about what this is:

- **It's a proclamation, not law** - Can be challenged in court
- **12-month duration** - Expires September 2026
- **Has exemptions** - "National interest" waiver possible
- **Will face lawsuits** - Remember what happened to other immigration proclamations?

Presidential proclamations get reversed all the time. Remember the H4 EAD drama? Still here. The "Buy American Hire American" order? Didn't stop H1Bs.

## What You Should Actually Do

### If You're in the US:
1. **Don't panic** - You're likely not affected
2. **Don't travel internationally** - Wait for clarification
3. **Focus on your business** - This changes nothing for self-sponsorship
4. **Consider O1** - Not affected by this at all

### If You're Outside the US:
1. **F1 student route** - Still viable
2. **O1 visa** - Completely unaffected
3. **L1 visa** - Not mentioned in proclamation
4. **Wait it out** - 12 months isn't forever

## The Real Target

Read the proclamation carefully. It's aimed at:
- IT outsourcing companies
- "Body shops" undercutting wages
- Companies laying off Americans while hiring H1Bs

It's NOT aimed at:
- Legitimate high-skilled workers
- Founders building companies
- People already contributing to the US economy

## Stop Listening to Fear Merchants

I'm already seeing lawyers posting "EMERGENCY WEBINARS" and "URGENT CONSULTATION" offers. They feed on your fear.

The same people who told you:
- "H1B is dead" in 2017 (still here)
- "H4 EAD will end" in 2019 (still here)  
- "Green cards impossible" in 2020 (people still getting them)

## The Bottom Line

If you're in the US, you're probably fine. If you're planning to travel, wait for clarification. If you're building a business, keep building.

The hardest part is actually having a business. Rest all is solvable.

This too shall pass. Every administration tries this. Courts push back. Business lobbies fight. Life goes on.

In my experience, these proclamations create more noise than actual change.

Focus on what you can control: Your business, your skills, your network.

Stop reading immigration forums. Start building your company.
