# Introducing WIN CLUB: The C.O.D.E Framework

**Or: How forcing functions create frameworks**

Tonight at 10 PM, I felt palm-sweating excitement.

Not because I'm launching something. Because founders keep asking me to clarify my own thinking.

That's the double whammy.

## The Forcing Function

I started H1Founders to help people avoid the misinformation that plagued my visa journey. It remains a side project.

First came the WhatsApp group. Q&A for 900+ founders navigating the visa maze.

Then some walked further down the path. They needed 1:1 coaching. I helped 19 founders break through their limiting beliefs.

One of them asked for more: *"I need a mentor to push me and hold me accountable."*

That became WIN CLUB. Private mentorship. Wed/Fri check-ins.

I limited this first cohort to existing coaching clients. I don't want to scale this. I run a full-time startup myself.

But here's what's interesting: WIN CLUB forced the **C.O.D.E Framework** into existence.

Without WIN CLUB launching tomorrow, I wouldn't have systematized what I know. The framework wouldn't exist.

They're not just paying for my time. They're paying me to extract and crystallize the employee-to-founder journey.

## The Problem Most Founders Have

You know what to do. You just refuse to win.

You hide behind:
- Mediocre thinking
- False limiting beliefs
- Average expectations
- Comfortable excuses

I've coached 19 founders. Same pattern every time. The breakthrough isn't new information. It's breaking through the thinking that keeps you average.

## The C.O.D.E Framework

Four pillars. Twelve dimensions. Measured on a 1-10 scale.

### **C = CREATE** (Technical Execution)
1. **AI Coding Skill** - Can you ship with Claude/AI tools?
2. **Systems Thinking** - Do you have daily systems or just goals?
3. **Metrics Mastery** - Do you know your numbers?

### **O = OWN** (Identity/Mindset)
4. **Self-Accountability** - "I own it" vs "circumstances messed me up"
5. **Decision Speed** - Analysis paralysis vs one-way door thinking
6. **Learning Velocity** - How defensive are you to feedback?

### **D = DRIVE** (Market/Revenue)
7. **Market Understanding** - Do you understand economics and value?
8. **Growth Execution** - Do you know CAC, LTV, channels?
9. **Focus/Fail Fast** - Can you kill bad ideas or are you distracted?

### **E = ENERGIZE** (Health/Foundation)
10. **Physical Health** - Do you workout consistently?
11. **Mental Practice** - Do you meditate or manage your mind?
12. **Energy Management** - Can you sustain this for years?

## Why Visual Proof Matters

Back in 2022, I took Tiago Forte's Building a Second Brain course.

The final deliverable was a "BASB Snapshot" - a radar chart showing 12 dimensions of my productivity system. Before vs After overlaid.

**I went from 30% → 57%.**

Almost 2x growth. Undeniable. You could SEE the transformation.

That visual proof hit different than any testimonial could.

That's what I'm building for WIN CLUB.

October 1: Baseline scores (1-10 on all 12 dimensions)
Mid-December: Final scores + radar chart

The transformation becomes visible. Not "I feel better." But "Look at this chart."

## What Happens Tomorrow

Tomorrow afternoon, three sessions begin.

Three founders. Twelve dimensions. Three months.

I'll see potential in them higher than they see in themselves. I'll call out every excuse before they finish making it. I'll make sure they don't let mediocre thinking win.

Each session gets recorded. I'll analyze patterns across all three. Extract what actually works.

This isn't about running a program. It's about systematizing the transformation from employee to founder.

## The Test

Every framework needs validation.

Will these three founders actually transform? Will the radar chart show real growth? Can I help them ship, make revenue, and own their decisions?

I don't know yet.

But tomorrow afternoon, we start finding out.

I'll share what happens.

*PS: Q1 2026 cohort opens in December. If you want in, watch what happens with these three first.*
