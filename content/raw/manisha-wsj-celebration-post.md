# Manisha WSJ Celebration Posts

## WhatsApp/Slack Version

ðŸŽ‰ **How many people can say a Wall Street Journal article starts with their name?**

**"Manisha Puppala, an Indian national who recently graduated..."** - That's how today's WSJ article begins.

Our own Manisha is now THE face of H1B reform in America's most prestigious business publication. She didn't seek this spotlight - she was just building, helping, solving problems every day. That's how opportunity works - it finds those doing the work.

But here's what most don't realize: **This WSJ feature is EB-1A gold.**

Media coverage in WSJ = "Published material about you in professional publications" âœ“
Leading platform development = "Critical role for distinguished organization" âœ“
Being the named example = "Evidence of your high standing" âœ“

This is exactly the kind of evidence that makes EB-1A applications undeniable. Not some random blog mention - THE WALL STREET JOURNAL.

My quote made it too: "This isn't reform, it's a sledgehammer... only companies with deepest pockets can play."

But Manisha's story is the real message: From $120K in student loans to WSJ feature to building solutions for all of us. She wasn't chasing press - she was chasing impact. The press found her.

This is what happens when you build stuff.

Congratulations @Manisha! ðŸš€

## Substack Version

**Title:** How Manisha Puppala Became the Face of H1B Reform in the Wall Street Journal

**Subtitle:** WSJ came for the solution story but published the victim narrative. Here's what they missed.

**How many people can say a Wall Street Journal article starts with their name?**

"Manisha Puppala, an Indian national who recently graduated with a master's degree in tech management from the Rochester Institute of Technology..."

That's the opening line of today's WSJ feature on H1B reform. Not buried in paragraph 10. Not a passing mention. THE LEAD.

Here's the thing - Manisha wasn't trying to get press. She was just showing up every day, building H1Founders, answering questions at midnight, creating tools during our lunch breaks. That's how real recognition happens - you don't chase it, it finds you while you're busy working.

**What WSJ didn't capture:** While they quoted Manisha asking "What do I do now?" - she already knew the answer. She's exploring the O-1 visa route (extraordinary ability in business), which is perfect for platform builders. We're not victims waiting for policy changes - we're builders creating alternative paths.

[SCREENSHOT 2: Paragraph mentioning "Puppala works for an AI firm called Trial and Error, where she is developing its community platform H1Founders..."]

The article mentions we're helping founders "sponsor themselves on other kinds of visas" but didn't explain HOW:
- O-1 visas for founders with traction
- EB-1A for those with extraordinary ability
- EB-2 NIW for founders whose work benefits America
- E-2 for those who can invest

We're not sitting around asking "what do we do?" - we have the playbook and we're executing it.

**For those thinking about EB-1A, pay attention:**

WSJ coverage isn't just press - it's the platinum standard of media evidence. When USCIS sees Wall Street Journal coverage, they don't question credibility. This single article provides:

- "Published material about you in professional/major trade publications" âœ“
- "Evidence that you have performed in a leading or critical role" âœ“
- "Evidence of your original contributions of major significance" âœ“

Manisha now has documentation that 99.9% of EB-1A applicants dream about. And she got it by doing the work, not by trying to get featured.

During the $100K fee panic last week, while consultancies charged $5K for "strategy calls," we were in WhatsApp groups at 11 PM answering questions. Manisha was building free tools. No fees, no gatekeeping - just founders helping founders figure this out together.

[SCREENSHOT 3: Your quote - "H-1B needed reform," said Sarasvati. "But this isn't reform, it's a sledgehammerâ€¦ this ensures that only companies with the deepest pockets can play."]

The article quotes me saying: "This isn't reform, it's a sledgehammer... this ensures that only companies with the deepest pockets can play."

But here's the irony: WSJ came to us for the solution story but published the victim narrative. They have quotes about "What do I do now?" but missed that we already have answers. They came because we were the ones actually DOING something during the crisis - not panicking, but building.

The real story: While others charged $5K for "visa strategy calls," we published free guides. While consultancies spread fear, we spread blueprints.

Manisha went from RIT student with $120K debt â†’ building H1Founders â†’ Wall Street Journal feature. In 6 months.

She didn't plan this trajectory. She just kept building.

That's what's possible when you stop waiting for permission and start creating value.

Proud to work alongside her.
