## Development Philosophy

### What We Ship
‚úÖ Features that generate revenue
‚úÖ Security and compliance fixes
‚úÖ User-requested improvements
‚úÖ Performance optimizations

### What We Don't Ship
‚ùå Vanity features
‚ùå Complex integrations without ROI
‚ùå Features that increase support burden
‚ùå Anything that compromises security

## Notes on Priorities

1. **Revenue First**: Every feature should drive MRR
2. **Security Always**: Never compromise member data
3. **User Feedback**: Build what members actually want
4. **Pragmatic Choices**: Ship MVPs, iterate based on usage
5. **Technical Debt**: Pay it down regularly
