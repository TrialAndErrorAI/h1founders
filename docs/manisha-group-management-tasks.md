## ONGOING TASK - WIN CLUB Pipeline

**Keep a running list of WIN CLUB candidates for Q1 2026 cohort (target: 5 people)**

**Where to look:**
1. **Tough Love coaching candidates** (primary source)
   - Swapnil, Akshya, Rana (already in your pipeline)
   - Anyone showing commitment + follow-through

2. **First $10K Club standouts**
   - Consistently posting Monday goals
   - Actually shipping (not just talking)
   - Authentic about struggles + wins

3. **Start a Business group**
   - Anyone who moves from idea → incorporated
   - Shows up weekly, asks smart questions
   - Not just consuming, contributing

**What to track (simple notes doc):**
```
Name | Source | Why potential WIN CLUB fit | Date noted
---
Swapnil | Tough Love | Shows up consistently, asks for hard truth | Oct 15
Rahul | First $10K | Posted $500 MRR, working nights after H1B job | Oct 20
```

**Why this matters:**
- Q1 2026 cohort needs to be READY (not cold outreach)
- Your Tough Love scheduling = you're seeing who's serious
- First $10K engagement = you're seeing who executes
- You become talent scout (valuable entrepreneurial skill)

**Report to Sid:**
- Monthly: "Here's 3 people who stood out this month"
- When Q1 approaches (Dec): "Here's my top 8 candidates for 5 spots"

Good entrepreneurs execute reliably. This is your practice ground.

## Learning Period (3 months: Oct 8 - Jan 8, 2026)

**What we're discovering together:**
- Can you build a self-sustaining weekly rhythm?
- Do you connect authentically with founders sharing wins?
- Does First $10K Club feel alive and supportive?
- Are you learning the discipline that makes entrepreneurs successful?

**After 3 months, we'll evaluate:**
- Growth: What community management skills did you master?
- Impact: Is First $10K Club thriving under your care?
- Next steps: Expand your role? Take on more responsibility?

This isn't pass/fail. It's: "Did we both get value from this experiment?"

**The entrepreneurial skill you're building:** Consistent execution without external accountability. That's the muscle every founder needs.
