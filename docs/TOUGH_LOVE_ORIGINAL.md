# Tough Love Coaching Series - H1B Founders
*Original Positioning - August 2025*

## The Offer
**$500/hr coaching. Zero cost. Pure truth.**

I'm opening 4-5 exclusive slots for H1B founders who are ready for brutal honesty, not feel-good fluff. This is the same coaching I charge $500/hr for - you're getting it free in exchange for letting us record and share the transformation.

## Why This Matters
Most H1B founders are stuck in employee mindset. They've been "thinking about it for months" but can't even articulate what they're building. They need someone who will cut through the BS and teach them to think like founders, not visa holders waiting for permission.

## What You Get
- 45-60 minute 1:1 with Sid
- Direct, no-sugarcoating feedback
- Actionable next steps (not theory)
- Recording becomes content that helps thousands

## What We've Already Proven
First episode recorded with Swapnil (Lovejoy) on Aug 27:
- Brave founder who went first and set the tone
- Real conversation about the challenges H1B founders face
- Breakthrough moments captured on video
- Shows the power of direct, honest feedback
- Ready to release as proof of the value

## Selection Criteria (for intake form)
- Current visa status (H1B, O1, F1-OPT)
- What you're building (be specific or get rejected)
- Biggest blocker right now (not "funding" - real problems)
- Why you need tough love vs another advisor
- Willing to be recorded/published (non-negotiable)

## The Positioning
"Your advisors are too nice. Your time is running out. You need someone who will tell you the truth about why you're failing and exactly how to fix it. This is $500/hr coaching for free - but only if you're ready to hear what you don't want to hear."

## Release Strategy
Option 1: Drop Swapnil episode first → "See what tough love looks like" → Open applications
Option 2: Open applications → Build anticipation → Drop Swapnil as Episode 1

My vote: Option 1. Show them the medicine before they sign up for treatment.

## Exclusive Access
- 4-5 slots only
- Application window: 48-72 hours max
- Selection announced within 1 week
- Recordings published 2 weeks after session

This isn't charity. It's content creation. They get $500/hr value. We get authentic transformation stories. Everyone wins if they can handle the truth.
