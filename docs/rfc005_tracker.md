## Performance Metrics

### Current (Phase 1)
- Page Load: ~1s
- Lighthouse Score: TBD
- Bundle Size: 553KB (needs optimization)
- SEO: Basic (needs improvement)

## Known Issues & Tech Debt
1. ⚠️ Bundle size too large (553KB) - needs code splitting
2. ⚠️ No real data source - using mock data
3. ⚠️ Email capture only in localStorage - needs backend
4. ⚠️ No authentication system yet
5. ⚠️ Missing SEO meta tags
6. ⚠️ No analytics tracking

---

## Risk Register
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Bundle size affecting performance | High | Implement code splitting in Phase 2 |
| No backend for data persistence | Medium | Use Cloudflare KV/D1 in Phase 3 |
| Legal disclaimers missing | High | Add to all tools immediately |
| Community moderation | Medium | Guidelines before Phase 3 |

## Deployment History
| Date | Version | Changes | URL |
