## Press Release

### H1Founders Launches Platform for 1,400+ Immigrant Entrepreneurs to Fast-Track Their EB1-A Green Cards

BOSTON, MA - September 2025 - H1Founders, the community that started with a single viral LinkedIn post about self-sponsoring an H1B visa, today launches its official platform serving 1,400+ immigrant founders across WhatsApp, Substack, and Slack.

Founded by Sid Sarasvati, CEO of RenovateAI and an EB1-A green card recipient, H1Founders transforms the decades-long wait for permanent residency into a 12-18 month sprint through the "extraordinary ability" pathway.

"I spent 15 years in the US, always 60 days from deportation if I lost my job," said Sarasvati. "The EB2 queue for Indians is 150 years. I got my green card through EB1-A by building my founder profile. Now I'm helping 1,400 others do the same."

The platform offers:
- **EB1-A Coaching**: $185 for 45-minute sessions with Sarasvati, who successfully navigated the process
- **Weekly Immigration Intel**: Updates on USCIS policy changes affecting founders
- **Founder Profiles**: Success stories and templates from members who achieved EB1-A
- **Partner Network**: Vetted immigration attorneys and service providers

In six months, H1Founders has grown from zero to 1,400 members, with a 50% Substack open rate and members reporting successful EB1-A approvals.

"The transformation isn't just legal status," notes Sarasvati. "It's mindset. From employee waiting for permission to founder earning extraordinary ability recognition."

H1Founders.com launches with founding sponsorship opportunities for companies seeking to reach high-value immigrant tech talent.

## FAQ

### Customer Questions

**Q: Who is this for?**
A: Immigrant founders and aspiring founders on any visa (H1-B, O-1, OPT, L-1) who are stuck in the decades-long EB2 green card queue. Primarily Indians and Chinese nationals who face 50-150 year waits.

**Q: What transformation are we selling?**
A: From "visa-trapped employee waiting decades for green card" to "self-sponsored founder achieving EB1-A in 12-18 months."

**Q: Why now?**
A: 
- USCIS increasingly favorable to founder EB1-A petitions

**Q: What's the business model?**

3. **Future: Course**: $997 EB1-A blueprint course (not in MVP)

**Q: How is this different from immigration lawyers?**

A: "Skip the 150-year EB2 line by building your founder profile for EB1-A, guided by someone who did it."
