## REVENUE BREAKDOWN (Per Incorporation)

**Revenue:** $3,500

**Costs:**
- FinStackk: $150 (allocated from $1,500/month ÷ 10 incorporations)
- Immigration: $1,050-$1,400 (30-40%)
- Filing fees: $100-200
- **Total Cost:** $1,300-$1,750

**Net Margin:** $1,750-$2,200 (50-63%)

**Volume Scenarios:**

| Incorporations | Revenue | Costs | Net Profit | Sid Time |
|---------------|---------|-------|------------|----------|
| 5/month | $17,500 | $7,500 | $10,000 | ~5 hours |
| 10/month | $35,000 | $15,000 | $20,000 | ~5 hours |
| 15/month | $52,500 | $22,500 | $30,000 | ~5 hours |

**Key Insight:** Manisha execution keeps Sid time constant (5 hours = oversight, not ops)

## COMPLIANCE & LEGAL PROTECTION

### What We ARE Doing (Legal)
- **Facilitating incorporation** (not practicing law)
- **Connecting founders to licensed professionals** (immigration lawyers, CPAs)
- **Providing general business education** (not legal advice)
- **Administrative coordination** (not fiduciary responsibility)

### What We ARE NOT Doing (Avoid Liability)
- ❌ Practicing law (immigration advice comes from licensed attorneys)
- ❌ Providing tax advice (comes from licensed CPAs)
- ❌ Guaranteeing outcomes ("This will get you O-1" = illegal)
- ❌ Acting as registered agents (use commercial service)

### Legal Disclaimers (REQUIRED)

**On Website/Marketing:**
```
H1Founders is not a law firm and does not provide legal or immigration advice.
Our incorporation package connects you with licensed professionals (immigration
attorneys and CPAs) who provide expert guidance. We facilitate the process but
do not guarantee any specific immigration or business outcomes.
```

**In Package Agreement (Founder Signs):**
```
By purchasing this package, you acknowledge:
1. H1Founders facilitates but does not provide legal, immigration, or tax advice
2. All professional advice comes from licensed third-party providers
3. We cannot guarantee Stripe approval, corporate filing timelines, or immigration outcomes
4. You are responsible for maintaining H1B compliance (consult your employer)
5. Refund policy: [TBD - likely prorated if we can't deliver promised services]
```

### Partner Liability Protection

**In Partner Contracts:**
- Partners carry their own professional liability insurance
- Partners are independent contractors (not H1Founders employees)
- Partners responsible for quality of their deliverables
- H1Founders not liable for partner errors or omissions

### Stripe Atlas Alternative

**If using Stripe Atlas:**
- Atlas handles corporate filing + compliance (reduces our liability)
- Cost: ~$500 (eat the cost or pass to founder)
- Benefit: Professional infrastructure + less risk

**If manual filing:**
- Use commercial registered agent (Northwest, Incfile)
- Template-based approach (no custom legal advice)
- Clear escalation: "Complex situation? We'll connect you to lawyer"

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Stripe Rejects Founders
**Mitigation:**
- Pre-qualify before taking payment (business idea, credit check)
- Help with reapplication if rejected
- Alternative: PayPal, Square (not ideal but backup)
- Refund policy: Partial refund if Stripe impossible

### Risk 2: Partners Don't Deliver
**Mitigation:**
- SLAs in partner contracts (deliverables within X days)
- Backup partners identified
- Refund policy: Full refund if we can't deliver promised services

### Risk 3: Founders Sue for Bad Outcomes
**Mitigation:**
- Clear disclaimers (we facilitate, not provide legal advice)
- Partner liability insurance (not ours)
- Signed agreement (founder acknowledges risks)
- Legal review before launching

### Risk 4: Manisha Can't Execute
**Mitigation:**
- 3-month trial starting with First $10K Club (lower stakes)
- If she fails simple tasks → don't give her incorporation execution
- Checklists + templates reduce decision-making burden
- Sid oversight on first 5 incorporations

### Risk 5: Immigration Partner Pisses Off Founders
**Mitigation:**
- Vet partner quality (call references from Achal, other founders)
- Feedback loop (founders rate partner after service)
- Ability to switch partners if quality drops
- Clear to founders: "Partner is independent, not H1Founders employee"

## OPEN DECISIONS

### 1. Stripe Atlas vs Manual Filing?
**Stripe Atlas Pros:**
- Professional infrastructure ($500 value)
- Reduces our liability
- Includes banking + Stripe in one

**Stripe Atlas Cons:**
- $500 cost (reduces margin or pass to founder)
- Less control over process
- Locked into Stripe ecosystem

**Decision Needed:** Test both approaches in soft launch?

### 2. FinStackk Pricing (Jan 2026 Renegotiation)
**Option A:** Flat fee ($2-3K/month)
- Predictable cost
- Easier accounting
- Risk: Overpay if low volume

**Option B:** % per incorporation (20-25% = $700-875 per)
- Scales with volume
- Incentive alignment
- Risk: Unpredictable monthly cost

**Decision:** Wait until Jan with real volume data

### 3. Immigration Partner (Sarah vs Manifest)
**Sarah Corstange:**
- Specialty: Early-stage + H1B (perfect fit)
- Achal endorsement (strong signal)
- Unknown pricing (need call)

**Manifest Labs:**
- $2,750/month (high fixed cost)
- Awaiting signature (momentum stalled?)
- Generic immigration (not startup-specific)

**Decision:** Call Sarah this week, compare pricing

### 4. Refund Policy
**Full Refund If:**
- We can't deliver promised services (partner fails, Stripe impossible)
- Timeline exceeds 8 weeks (our fault)

**Partial Refund If:**
- Founder changes mind mid-process (% based on work completed)
- Stripe rejects but we delivered other services

**No Refund If:**
- Founder fails to provide required docs
- Founder's situation changes (loses H1B, etc.)

**Decision:** Legal review required
