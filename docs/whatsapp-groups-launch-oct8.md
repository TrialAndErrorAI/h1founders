### Post 2: First $10K Club (Sid Personal)

```
Most immigrant founders quit before $10K.

Not because idea is bad.
Because building alone is hard.

Launching First $10K Club - weekly accountability for founders actively building.

Share revenue (even $0), learn what's working, help each other get to first $10,000.

Consumer or B2B doesn't matter. Revenue matters.
