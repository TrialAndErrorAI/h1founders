# WIN CLUB Sales Frame Mastery
*Captured from Swapnil pitch - September 18, 2025*

## THE FRAME: You're QUALIFYING, Not Selling

### Opening Power Questions (Get Them Vulnerable)
> "How many days a week do you wake up and feel like this is not going to fucking happen?"

This immediately:
- Makes them confront their reality
- Shifts power to you (therapist position)
- Opens emotional truth, not logical defense

### Make Them Name Their Villain
> "Are those fears vague or specific?"

> "At least step one of conquering any fear is to identify it. When you name a villain, it becomes less scary."

Swapnil's response: "Two things - work ethic and lack of technical skills"
Perfect - specific, addressable, not nebulous anxiety.

## THE POSITIONING: Limited by Design

### Scarcity Frame
> "I can only take 5 people. I don't want to scale this. It's not a business I want to scale."

> "Unfortunately, this is not something I can scale."

This creates:
- Exclusivity (not desperate)
- Quality over quantity
- You're doing them a favor

### The Belief Transfer
> "I would have loved somebody to believe in me who could see potential that I couldn't see"

> "It's kind of like working out - if you have a coach who can push you hard"

> "Sometimes you want to dial the ego up. Ego is a tool. You got to dial it up to do the impossible."

## HANDLING OBJECTIONS: Don't Chase

### When They Say "I'm Broke"
What Swapnil said: "I'm so broke I can't even order food"

Your perfect response:
> "No pressure, but it's an investment in yourself"

> "Price gives you skin in the game. Free stuff doesn't work."

> "When you're ready, you find the right people in your life"

Never:
- Discount immediately
- Beg or convince
- Get defensive about price

## THE MISSION FRAME: Bigger Than Money

When complimented about building Y Combinator:
> "My goal is that people are living in mental slavery and have limiting beliefs"

> "H1B was the starting point... we all have so much fear"

> "How many people aspire to be founders? Very few. It's not an easy path. It's a warrior's path. It's a battle."

## THE CLOSE: Give Them an Out

### Create Decision Pressure
> "Let me know by Sunday"

> "I've reached out to everybody who's taken coaching with me first"

> "I haven't posted on WhatsApp yet" (implies it will fill up)

### But Don't Need Them
> "If you feel you are ready, then it's about learning to win"

> "It's up to you... when you're ready, you find the right people"

## PARTNERSHIP CALL PRACTICE SCRIPTS

### For FinStackk (Friday 11 AM)
**Opening Frame:**
"You reached out to ME after seeing the WhatsApp post. Tell me - what's your vision for working with 1,400 founders who all need accounting but don't trust traditional firms?"

**Scarcity Frame:**
"I'm only taking one accounting partner. Exclusive access. The question is whether FinStackk can handle founder-specific needs at scale."

**Close Frame:**
"$3K/month for exclusive access. October 1st start. But honestly, I need to know you understand these aren't regular SMBs - these are visa holders building venture-scale companies. Can you handle that?"

### For Integrated Business Financing (Friday 12 PM)
**Opening Frame:**
"Our founders need funding but banks don't understand immigrant founders. You do SBA loans - how many H1B founders have you actually funded?"

**Challenge Frame:**
"Most lenders see visa status as risk. I see it as hunger. These founders work 3x harder because they have no safety net. Do you get that?"

**Value Frame:**
"$2K/month gets you 1,400 pre-qualified founders who NEED funding. But I only want a partner who sees their potential, not their limitations."

## THE ENERGY TO CHANNEL

Before each call, read these lines OUT LOUD:
- "I make winners. People refuse to win. I won't let them."
- "Free stuff doesn't work. Investment creates commitment."
- "I don't need your money. You need to stop being stuck."
- "Winners decide fast. Average overthinks."
- "How serious are you about changing your life?"

## THE TEST

After every pitch, ask yourself:
1. Did I qualify them or sell to them?
2. Did I create scarcity or seem desperate?
3. Did I believe in them more than they believe in themselves?
4. Did I give them an out or trap them?

If you qualified, created scarcity, believed in them, and gave them an out - you won.
