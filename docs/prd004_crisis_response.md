# PRD004: H1B Crisis Response & Substack Integration
**Date**: September 21, 2025
**Status**: URGENT - SHIP TODAY
**Author**: NEXUS (CPTO)
**Validated**: ATLAS

## Problem
Trump's $100K H1B proclamation created global panic. 850+ founders flooding WhatsApp. Predatory firms launching "emergency webinars". We have 48-72 hours of peak attention to capture this traffic and establish H1BFounders as THE authority.

## Solution
Transform crisis into growth by providing clarity while others spread fear.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: TODAY (2 hours)
1. **Crisis Banner** on homepage
   - Text: "ðŸ“¢ H1B $100K Update: Get Facts, Not Fear â†’"
   - Links to Crisis Tracker page
   - Sticky position at top

2. **Crisis Tracker Page** (/crisis)
   - Latest verified updates (not rumors)
   - "What Actually Changed" summary
   - WhatsApp group link (capture traffic)
   - "Verified by 850+ founders" social proof

### Phase 1: THIS WEEK (Day 2-3)
3. **Substack RSS Integration**
   - Embed latest 3 posts on homepage
   - "Continue reading on Substack" links
   - Auto-refresh every hour

4. **WhatsApp â†’ Platform Funnel**
   - Special landing: /welcome-crisis
   - Skip heavy onboarding
   - Direct to Crisis Tracker + Forum

### Phase 2: NEXT WEEK (Day 4-7)
5. **Content Mirror System**
   - Import Substack posts as Forum threads
   - Keep discussion on platform
   - Build SEO on both domains

6. **Email Bridge**
   - Substack subscribers â†’ Forum access
   - Forum members â†’ Substack early access
   - Unified list for partners

## Success Metrics
- **Hour 1**: Crisis banner live
- **Day 1**: 100+ new forum signups
- **Day 3**: 1000+ WhatsApp members
- **Week 1**: 3 partners inquiring ($25K+ pipeline)

## Technical Specs

### Crisis Banner Component
```tsx
// Sticky banner with high-contrast warning style
<div className="bg-yellow-400 text-black p-3 text-center font-bold sticky top-0 z-50">
  ðŸ“¢ H1B $100K Update: Get Facts, Not Fear â†’
</div>
```

### RSS Integration
- Library: react-rss or manual fetch

### Crisis Tracker Data
- Source: Firestore collection 'crisis_updates'

## Security
