## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Authentication Flow
```typescript
// SMS Authentication Process
1. User enters phone: formatPhoneNumber() → +1XXXXXXXXXX
2. Firebase sends SMS via Twilio
3. reCAPTCHA verification (invisible mode)
4. 6-digit code validation
5. Create UserProfile in Firestore:
   {
     uid: firebase_uid,
     phone: "+1XXXXXXXXXX",
     matrixLevel: "UNPLUGGED", // Default
     specialBadges: ["OG_FOUNDER"] | [], // If WhatsApp member
     isWhatsappMember: boolean,
     profileComplete: false,
     username: "anonymous_founder"
   }
6. Redirect to /dashboard
```

### Badge System Logic
```typescript
// Matrix Progression (7 levels)
BLUE_PILL → UNPLUGGED → FREED_MIND → NEO → MORPHEUS → THE_ORACLE → THE_ARCHITECT

// Special Badges (stackable)
- 👑 OG_FOUNDER: Original WhatsApp members (March 2024)
- 💬 WHATSAPP_MEMBER: Part of WhatsApp group
- 📧 SUBSTACK_SUBSCRIBER: Newsletter subscriber
- ✅ VERIFIED: Platform verification

// Default Assignment
New User: 🟡 UNPLUGGED + special badges if applicable
```

### Route Protection
```typescript
// Public Routes (no auth required)
["/", "/forum", "/tools", "/resources", "/stories", "/events"]

// Protected Routes (auth required)  
["/dashboard", "/network"]

// Auth Success Redirect
/network → Phone Auth → /dashboard
```

```
