# RFC-009: Forum-First Content Architecture
**Scope**: Every piece of content is a forum post with special properties
**Priority**: HIGH - Launch in 3 days, not 3 weeks
**Author**: ATLAS
**Date**: September 11, 2025
**Status**: UPDATED - Forum-first approach

## Executive Summary
The forum IS the content platform. Every piece of content becomes a forum post with special properties. Launch-ready in 3 days, scales to full vision over time. No separate CMS needed.

## The Problem
- 36+ static content pieces disconnected from community
- Two separate systems (content pages vs forum)
- No engagement on content
- Complex architecture delaying launch

## Phase 1: Forum-First Architecture (Launch Ready)

### Core Principle: Everything is a Forum Post

**Content Types (enum in forum.types.ts):**
```typescript
enum ContentType {
  STORY = 'story',              // Personal narratives
  EVENT = 'event',              // Office hours, meetups  
  KNOWLEDGE = 'knowledge',      // Guides, how-tos
  TOOL = 'tool',                // Embedded calculators
  WISDOM = 'wisdom',            // Curated insights
  SUBSTACK = 'substack',        // Imported posts
  ANNOUNCEMENT = 'announcement' // Platform updates
}
```

**Extended Post Properties:**
```typescript
interface ForumPost {
  // Existing forum fields...
  
  // Content-specific additions
  contentType?: ContentType
  isPinned?: boolean       // Sid can pin important content
  isOfficial?: boolean     // From H1Founders team
  sourceUrl?: string       // If imported from Substack/YouTube
  eventDate?: Date         // For events
  toolEmbed?: string       // Calculator iframe URL
  featured?: boolean       // Show on homepage
}
```

## Phase 3: Long-Term Vision (3-Layer System Still Valid)

The forum-first approach doesn't break the 3-layer vision - it accelerates it:

### Layer 1: Content Sources (Automated)
- Substack RSS feed ‚Üí Forum posts
- YouTube transcripts ‚Üí Forum posts  
- WhatsApp wisdom ‚Üí Forum posts
- All content lives IN the forum, not separate

### Layer 2: Processing (In-Forum)
- Posts get votes, comments, edits
- Community validates and evolves content
- Scoring happens via engagement metrics
- No separate CMS needed

### Layer 3: Learning Paths (Post Collections)
- Curated sequences of forum posts
- Badge progression via completing paths
- Unlocks based on engagement
- Still uses forum as foundation

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Build markdown parser with frontmatter
- [ ] Import 10 Substack posts as test
- [ ] Create basic scoring function
- [ ] Display in forum sidebar

### Phase 2: Automation (Week 2)
- [ ] Substack RSS ingestion
- [ ] YouTube transcript extraction
- [ ] AI enhancement pipeline
- [ ] WhatsApp anonymization script
- [ ] Auto-generate discussion threads

### Phase 3: Learning Paths (Week 3)

## Technical Decisions

### Storage Choice: Markdown + JSON Sidecar
**Why:**
- Git-trackable for version history
- AI-readable for enhancement
- Human-editable for maintenance
- Portable across platforms

### ID Format: Semantic with Counter
Format: `[category]-[topic]-[number]`
Example: `visa-horror-001`, `funding-seed-001`
**Why:** Human-readable, sortable, collision-free

### Commenting: Forum Integration
- Each content piece gets auto-thread
- Comments live in forum, not content
- Preserves engagement in one place
- Enables badge progression through discussion

## Success Metrics

## The Vision

**6 Months from now:**
A new member joins H1BFounders. Within minutes, they're on a personalized learning path based on their situation. They read Sid's visa horror story, immediately see 23 community members who faced similar situations, and join the discussion. Their engagement unlocks the next piece of content. By day 7, they've consumed exactly what they needed, connected with the right people, and progressed toward FREED_MIND. The content evolved based on their questions, and their journey becomes content for the next member.

This isn't documentation. It's **living community wisdom**.

## Next Actions

1. **Create directory structure** in repo
2. **Import 5 Substack posts** as test
3. **Build scoring function** prototype
4. **Design learning path** for onboarding
5. **Connect to forum** for discussions
