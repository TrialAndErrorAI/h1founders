# H1Founders Critical Decisions Log
**Last Updated**: December 2024
**Purpose**: Document irreversible (one-way door) and reversible (two-way door) decisions

## ðŸšª One-Way Door Decisions (Irreversible)

### 1. Matrix Terminal Aesthetic
**Decision**: Full commitment to Matrix/terminal theme across entire platform
**Colors**: 
- Background: #0d0208 (near-black)
- Primary: #00ff41 (Matrix green)
- Danger/CTA: #ff073a (red pill)
- Secondary: #1e3a8a (blue pill)
**Why One-Way**: Brand identity is established, community expects it, marketing materials use it
**Made**: RFC-004 (September 2024)

### 2. Phone-First Authentication
**Decision**: SMS/WhatsApp phone verification as primary auth method
**Why One-Way**: 
- 781 WhatsApp members already using phone
- No passwords aligns with WhatsApp UX
- Phone numbers are harder to fake than emails
**Made**: RFC-006 (September 2024)

### 3. Firebase Stack (Auth + Firestore)
**Decision**: Firebase for authentication and database
**Why One-Way**:
- Matches existing RenovateAI infrastructure (Sid's company)
- Team already knows Firebase
- Migration would be expensive
**Made**: RFC-006 (September 2024)

### 4. Five-Section Platform Architecture
**Decision**: TOOLS / RESOURCES / STORIES / EVENTS / NETWORK / ACADEMY
**Why One-Way**:
- URLs are indexed by Google
- Users have bookmarked sections
- Navigation expectations are set
**Made**: RFC-005 (September 2024)

### 5. Badge Progression Revenue Model
**Decision**: 7-level badge system tied to paid programs
**Levels**: Blue Pill â†’ Unplugged â†’ Freed Mind â†’ Neo â†’ Morpheus â†’ Oracle â†’ Architect
**Why One-Way**: Core business model, psychological progression, community status system
**Made**: RFC-007 (September 2024)
**Note**: Specific pricing tiers defined internally, not public-facing

### 6. H1Founders Brand Name
**Decision**: "H1Founders" not "H1BFounders"
**Why One-Way**: Domain purchased, SEO building, community knows the name
**Made**: Initial founding (March 2024)

## ðŸ”„ Two-Way Door Decisions (Reversible)

**Alternative**: Could migrate to Next.js for SSR/SEO
**Migration Cost**: ~1 week of work
**Status**: Keep for now, revisit if SEO becomes critical

### 2. Cal.com for Booking
**Current**: Embed Cal.com for coaching bookings
**Alternative**: Build custom booking system
**Migration Cost**: ~3 days
**Status**: Cal.com until we need custom features

### 3. localStorage for MVP
**Current**: Using browser localStorage for persistence
**Next Step**: Firebase Firestore
**Migration Cost**: ~2 days
**Status**: Actively migrating to Firebase

### 4. Partnership Pricing Tiers
**Current Tiers**:
- Blue Pill Sponsor: $1K/month
- Red Pill Partner: $5K/month
- Neo Partner: $10K/month
- Architect Alliance: $25K/month
**Status**: Can adjust based on market feedback

### 5. Forum Category Names
**Current**: The Construct, The Matrix, The Real World, Zion, Oracle's Chamber
**Proposed Change**: Zion â†’ Club H1 (premium tier)
**Migration Cost**: ~1 hour
**Status**: RFC-007.1 pending implementation

### 6. Cloudflare Pages Deployment
**Current**: Cloudflare Pages
**Alternative**: Vercel, Netlify, AWS
**Migration Cost**: ~2 hours
**Status**: Working well, no need to change

## ðŸ“Š Decision Framework

### One-Way Door Criteria
- Affects brand perception
- Has network effects
- Creates user habits
- Expensive to reverse (>1 week of work)
- Has contractual commitments

### Two-Way Door Criteria
- Technical implementation detail
- Internal tooling choice
- Pricing/packaging (can A/B test)
- Feature flags can control
- <1 week to reverse

## ðŸŽ¯ Pending Decisions

### Needs Decision Soon
1. **Payment Processor**: Stripe vs alternatives (leaning Stripe via Cal.com)
2. **Email Provider**: ConvertKit vs Substack vs custom
3. **Forum Monetization**: Free tier vs fully paid
4. **Mobile App**: PWA vs React Native vs none

### Can Defer
1. **CMS Integration**: Markdown files working fine
2. **Analytics Platform**: Basic analytics sufficient
3. **CDN Strategy**: Cloudflare handling it
4. **Internationalization**: US-only for now

## ðŸ’¡ Lessons Learned
