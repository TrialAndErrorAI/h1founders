# PRD: Win Club - The Mental Freedom Accelerator
*Product Requirements Document - December 2024*

## Problem Statement
After breaking through initial mental barriers in a coaching call, founders still wake up with fear. They need ongoing support to maintain founder identity and push through daily doubts. One-off coaching isn't enough for sustained transformation.

## The Real Problem We're Solving
**"How many days a week do you wake up and feel like this is not going to fucking happen?"**

Most founders face this daily. They need:
1. Someone who believes in them when they can't
2. Accountability to break permission-seeking patterns
3. Regular mental reprogramming (not just one-off)
4. A coach who pushes them like a trainer pushes athletes

## Win Club Solution

### Core Offering
- **Price**: $497/month
- **Format**: 20 minutes, 2x per week (Zoom)
- **Access**: WhatsApp for async support
- **Size**: Limited to 5 people (by design, not scaling)
- **Duration**: Month-to-month (no long-term contracts)

### What Makes It Different
1. **NOT immigration consulting** - Mental freedom coaching
2. **NOT a course** - Live accountability and pushing
3. **NOT scalable** - Intentionally limited for quality
4. **NOT for everyone** - We qualify them, not sell to them

## Target Member Profile

### Who This Is For
- Stuck in "How can I?" loops for months/years
- Have specific fears (work ethic, technical skills, visa)
- Ready to invest in transformation, not information
- Want someone to believe in them
- Need external push to break mental patterns

### Who This Is NOT For
- Looking for visa tactics (get a lawyer)
- Want passive content consumption
- Not ready to be pushed hard
- Can't afford $497/month without stress
- Think they can do it alone

## The Psychology (From Sales Doc)

### Opening Frame
"How many days a week do you wake up feeling like this won't happen?"
- Makes them vulnerable immediately
- Shifts to therapist/coach dynamic
- Opens emotional truth, not logical defense

### Naming Villains
"Are those fears vague or specific?"
- Forces them to identify actual blockers
- Makes fears less scary when named
- Creates addressable problems

### Belief Transfer
"I would have loved somebody to believe in me who could see potential I couldn't"
- Positions as mentor, not service provider
- Creates emotional connection
- Shows we've been there

## Win Club Page Structure

### Hero Section
**Headline**: "Still Waking Up Scared?"
**Subhead**: "How many days a week do you feel like this won't fucking happen?"

### The Problem
- You had a breakthrough but fear returns daily
- You know what to do but can't make yourself do it
- You're stuck in planning, not executing
- Your identity hasn't fully shifted yet

### The Solution
**Win Club**: 20 minutes, 2x/week to reprogram your mind
- I push you like a trainer pushes athletes
- We name your villains and destroy them
- WhatsApp access when fear strikes
- Limited to 5 founders (not scaling this)

### Qualification Questions
Before applying, answer honestly:
1. Are you executing or still planning?
2. Can you commit to 2x/week calls?
3. Will $497/month stress your finances?
4. Are you ready to be pushed HARD?
5. Do you want accountability or just information?

### The Investment
$497/month
- Less than your daily coffee budget
- Skin in the game (free doesn't work)

## The Frame That Matters

**We're not selling Win Club. We're qualifying who deserves our time.**

When someone says "I'm broke" or "I need to think about it" - perfect. We don't chase. We say:
- "No pressure, it's an investment in yourself"
- "Free stuff doesn't work - you need skin in the game"
- "This isn't for everyone"

The right people will fight to get in. The wrong people will self-select out.

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Landing Page
- Create /win-club page with qualification focus
- Add to navigation (or keep hidden)
- Link from coaching page

### Phase 2: Application Flow
- Qualification quiz
- Discovery call booking
- Clear acceptance/rejection process

### Phase 3: Delivery
- Zoom recurring setup
- WhatsApp group creation
- Week 1 intensive onboarding

## The Core Philosophy

Win Club isn't about teaching immigration tactics. It's about:
1. **Breaking daily fear patterns**
2. **Installing founder identity permanently**
3. **Having someone who believes in you**
4. **Accountability to execute, not plan**

The $497 isn't for information - it's for transformation. The members who join don't need more content. They need someone to push them past their mental barriers every single week until those barriers stop existing.
