# Start a Business - Product Strategy
**H1Founders Premium Product Line**

**Created:** October 7, 2025
**Status:** Phase 1 - Free Group Launch
**Target Revenue:** $50K+ (Q1 2026)

---

## Vision

Enable H1B founders to go from idea → incorporated → revenue-ready business with zero confusion and proper legal/compliance foundation.

**The Gap We Fill:**
- Immigration lawyers don't understand startups ($5K+ for generic advice)
- Accountants charge $500/hour for basic setup
- Founders waste 6 months figuring out Stripe, corporate structure, compliance
- Most give up before starting

**Our Solution:**
Complete incorporation package: Immigration strategy + corporate structure + Stripe + accounting. $3,500. 3-4 weeks. Done.

---

## Product Positioning

### Core Marketing Message
> "Join 47 H1B founders who incorporated in 2025."

That's it. Social proof = entire pitch.

### Cultural Psychology (Indian Founder Playbook)
- **Wedding Principle:** Will pay $50K for wedding, haggle over $50 service
- **Business incorporation = Wedding-level life event** (visa pathway, American dream)
- **Relative comparison:** "If others paid, I should too"
- **1000 questions:** Pre-answer everything with comprehensive FAQ

### Pricing Strategy
- **Anchor:** "$7-8K if you hire immigration lawyer + accountant separately"
- **Bundle:** "$3,500 for everything through H1Founders"
- **Social proof:** "47 founders already incorporated this way"
- **FOMO:** "Q4 2025 cohort closing (12 spots left)"

**Price Point:** $3,500
- Not $2,500 (too cheap, they doubt quality)
- Not $5,000 (lose volume)
- $3,500 = sweet spot (feels like deal vs $7K separate)

## Risk Mitigation

### Legal/Compliance Risks
- [ ] Legal review of package terms (what we promise vs deliver)
- [ ] Clear disclaimers (we facilitate, not provide legal advice)
- [ ] Partner contracts protect H1Founders from liability
- [ ] Terms of service for paid package

### Operational Risks
**Risk:** Can't deliver in 3-4 weeks
**Mitigation:** Manual first 10, document bottlenecks, automate later

**Risk:** Partner drops out mid-process
**Mitigation:** Backup partners identified, refund policy clear

**Risk:** Founders don't get Stripe approved
**Mitigation:** Pre-qualify before taking payment, help with reapplication

### Demand Risks
**Risk:** Nobody pays $3,500
**Mitigation:** Free group validates demand first, social proof builds FOMO

- **We win:** Complete package, faster, cheaper

**DIY Route:**
- Cost: $500-1,000 (filing fees)
