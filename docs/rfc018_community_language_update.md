# RFC 018: Community Language & Mission Alignment Update
**Status**: URGENT - Implement now
**Created**: September 27, 2025
**Owner**: NEXUS

## Context
- We have WhatsApp Community structure now: "H1 Founders Network"
- Website still references "WhatsApp Group" (outdated)
- Mission crystallized: "MERITOCRACY WINS" - Enable smartest people to build in America based on merit
- Need language updates across platform to align with mission

## Current Issues
1. Website invites to "WhatsApp Group" not "H1 Founders Network Community"
2. Generic language doesn't reflect our mission (merit > lottery)
3. Copy focuses on problems not solutions
4. Not leveraging WSJ credibility enough

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. WhatsApp Community Updates
**Find and replace across all pages:**
- "Join our WhatsApp Group" → "Join H1 Founders Network"
- "WhatsApp group with 850+ members" → "WhatsApp Community with 860+ immigrant founders"
- Add subtext: "The official community for immigrant founders. Build, grow, exit."

**Key locations:**
- Hero section CTA
- Community component
- Footer
- Any modal/popup CTAs

### 2. Mission-Oriented Language Updates

**Homepage Hero:**
- Current: Generic H1B messaging
- New: "Merit Wins. Lottery Loses. Build Your Path to America."

**Transformation Section:**
- Add: "We help those who CREATE VALUE, not those waiting for handouts"
- Emphasize: Builders vs Beggars mentality

**Community Section:**
- Current: "Join 850+ founders"
- New: "Join builders who transcend visa limitations"
- Add: "Are you building or begging? The test is simple."

### 3. WSJ Credibility Integration
**Add to key sections:**
- "As featured in The Wall Street Journal"
- "The go-to platform during the H1B crisis" (subtle reference)

### 4. Specific Page Updates

**Tools Pages:**
- Frame as "Build Your Evidence" not just calculators
- "Every action here builds your extraordinary ability profile"

**Resources:**
- Less "how to get H1B"
- More "paths beyond H1B" (O-1, EB-1A, EB-2 NIW)

**Forum:**
- Welcome message: "This is where builders share, not where beggars ask"
- Emphasize value creation discussions

### 5. CTA Button Updates
- "Join WhatsApp" → "Join the Network"
- "Get Started" → "Start Building"
- "Learn More" → "Prove Your Merit"

## Copy Principles
1. **Merit over lottery** - Always emphasize earned vs random
2. **Builders over beggars** - Action-oriented language
3. **Solutions over problems** - We have answers, not complaints
4. **Evidence over hope** - Build your case, don't wait for luck

## Testing
After updates, verify:
- [ ] All WhatsApp links point to Community (not group)
- [ ] Mission alignment in main messaging
- [ ] No "victim" language remaining
- [ ] CTAs use action verbs (Build, Create, Prove)

## Success Metrics
- New signups understand merit-based approach immediately
- Community invite links work for H1 Founders Network
- Reduced "how to get H1B lottery" questions
- Increased O-1/EB-1A interest
