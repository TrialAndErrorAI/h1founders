# RFC-008: Tough Love Coaching Platform
**Date**: September 8, 2025  
**Author**: Atlas for Sid  
**Status**: Draft  
**Target Launch**: September 12, 2025 (with first video)

## Summary
Implement a first-class coaching section on H1Founders that showcases Tough Love Coaching sessions, drives engagement, and creates backlink opportunities with featured founders.

## Problem Statement
- We have valuable coaching content (Swapnil session recorded)
- Need premium presentation that matches Matrix aesthetic
- Want to drive traffic and create SEO value through founder backlinks
- Must support video embeds, clips, and social distribution

## Proposed Solution

### 1. Navigation Update
Add "COACHING" as primary nav item (same level as FORUM, TOOLS, RESOURCES)

### 2. Coaching Page Structure
```
/coaching
├── Hero: Current Episode Player
├── Upcoming Sessions Schedule  
├── Apply for Slot (CTA)
├── Past Episodes Gallery
└── Founder Spotlight Section
```

### 3. Matrix-Style Video Player
```typescript
// Custom YouTube embed with Matrix theme
<div className="terminal-player">
  <div className="player-header">
    > LOADING_BREAKTHROUGH.exe
    > Episode_001: Swapnil_Pivot.mp4
  </div>
  <div className="video-wrapper matrix-glow">
    <iframe 
      src="https://youtube.com/embed/[VIDEO_ID]"
      className="matrix-video"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="player-stats">
    Duration: 45:12 | Views: 1,337 | Breakthroughs: 3
  </div>
</div>
```

### 4. Founder Spotlight Component
Each featured founder gets:
- Name + company with backlink
- Key breakthrough moment
- Their transformation metrics
- Link to their site (SEO juice exchange)

### 5. Clips Gallery
```typescript
interface CoachingClip {
  title: string;        // "The $50K Pivot"
  duration: string;     // "2:34"
  videoId: string;      // YouTube ID
  founder: string;      // "Swapnil"
  breakthrough: string; // What they discovered
  backlink?: string;    // Their website
}
```

### 6. Application Flow
- Embedded Typeform/Google Form
- Auto-notify Manisha on submission
- Display "X slots remaining" dynamically
- Queue management for next month
