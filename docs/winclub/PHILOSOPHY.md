> **"I'm looking for a mentor to mainly push me and hold me accountable"** - Saurabh, Sept 2025

## The Origin

Saurabh's email that started it all:

```
Hi Sid

I'm part of the H1B founders whatsapp group and also had a session with you recently.

I am looking for a mentor to mainly push me and hold me accountable as I try to
start my vibe coded SaaS solopreneurship journey.

It would be great to have a mentor who I can check in with thrice a week,
with each session not more than 20 mins.

Wondering if you or somebody you're aware of offers that.

Thanks for reading this.
```

## What It Is

Like Tough Love, but dedicated time.

I'll coach what I know - went from zero to hero. Let's see if they have what it takes.

They took the first step (invested in themselves), so I'm happy to offer help.

## The Format

- 20 min, 2x/week (Wed & Fri)
- Direct WhatsApp access
- 5 founders MAX
- $497/month

## The Word

**Saurabh's payment note**: "Mentorship"

Not coaching. MENTORSHIP.
