### Email 1: The Launch
**Date**: Thursday, September 18, 2025 at 10:05 PM EDT  
**Subject**: Opening WIN CLUB (5 spots only, Q4 2025)

```
Hey [Name],

Someone from our coaching session asked me to hold them accountable weekly. It made me realize‚Äîmost of you know what to do; you just refuse to win.

Creating something exclusive:

**WIN CLUB - Q4 2025**
* Wed & Fri accountability (20 min)
* Direct WhatsApp access
* I'll see potential in you higher than you see in yourself
* I'll call out every excuse before you finish making it
* $497/month (Oct-Dec)

Only 5 spots. Not scaling this.

You've experienced my coaching. You know I don't let mediocre thinking win.

Reply by Sunday midnight if you want in.
Opening to WhatsApp group Monday if spots remain.

### Email 2: The Personal Response (When They Show Interest)
**Subject**: Re: Opening WIN CLUB

```
[Name],

Distribution aligns directly with your product strategy‚Äîno separation there. You need rapid iteration on diff strategies here and fail fast.

Regarding job searches and interviews, I can assist with that too. My approach is essentially life coaching, but we'll tie it to focused, actionable objectives.

The key question for you: Are you ready to take in feedback and act on it? I'll highlight the truth‚Äîwill you choose to see it? You'd be surprised how often people don't.
```

### Email 3: The Social Proof Push
**Date**: Sunday, September 21, 2025 at 10:03 PM EDT
