### H1Founders Launches WIN CLUB: Exclusive Private Mentorship for Immigrant Founders Who Refuse to Stay Average

**Boston, MA - January 2026** - H1Founders today announced that its WIN CLUB private mentorship program has helped 20 immigrant founders increase their monthly revenue by an average of 3x in just 90 days, with the program expanding to serve 60 founders annually at premium price points.

WIN CLUB solves a critical problem: immigrant founders know what to do but refuse to win. They hide behind visa anxiety, cultural conditioning to stay modest, and the comfort of planning instead of shipping. Traditional coaching gives tactics; WIN CLUB provides transformation through exclusive 1:1 mentorship.

"Most immigrant founders are brilliant but broken," said Sid Sarasvati, founder of H1Founders and creator of WIN CLUB. "They'll spend 100 hours perfecting code but won't spend 10 minutes asking for the sale. WIN CLUB forces them to confront their mediocre thinking and ship real products that make real money."

The program operates in quarterly cohorts of just 5 founders, with twice-weekly 20-minute 1:1 sessions that focus on execution, not education. Members get direct WhatsApp access to Sid between sessions, ensuring they can't hide behind excuses.

Early results validate the model:
- Saurabh shipped his B2B product and closed first enterprise client
- Harshdeep pivoted from endless development to distribution, landing 3 paying customers
- Khasim stopped hiding behind his H1B and launched his side business

Starting at $497/month for Q4 2025, the program now commands $1,497/month for 2026 cohorts, with a waitlist of 50+ founders. Unlike scaled coaching programs, WIN CLUB intentionally limits each cohort to 5 members, creating exclusivity that drives both results and demand.

## FAQ

### Why is this better than regular coaching or courses?
Coaching is transactional - you get tactics. Courses are passive - you get information. WIN CLUB is transformational - you get a mentor who refuses to let you fail. The twice-weekly cadence creates unavoidable accountability. You can't hide.

### Who is this for?
Immigrant founders (H1B, OPT, green card) who have something built but refuse to ship it. You must have a product (even if incomplete) and be ready to sell it. This is not for idea-stage founders or those "exploring options."

### Why only 5 spots per cohort?
Exclusivity drives commitment. When you're one of five, you can't hide in the crowd. Each session is 1:1. Sid personally knows your business, your blockers, and your excuses. This doesn't scale, and that's the point.

### How does the progression work?
- Q4 2025: $497/month (Founding cohort) - SOLD OUT
- Q1 2026: $697/month - 3 spots remaining
- Q2 2026: $997/month - Waitlist open
- Q3 2026: $1,497/month - Application required

Price increases each quarter as success stories compound and demand exceeds supply.

### What's the time commitment?
- 40 minutes per week (2x 20-min sessions)
- Wed & Fri at your designated time
- 3-month minimum commitment
- WhatsApp access between sessions

### What if I can't afford $497/month?
Then you're not ready. WIN CLUB members invest in themselves before they're comfortable. If you're waiting to afford it, you'll wait forever. Winners find a way.

### How do I know if I'll get results?
You don't. But if you're asking this question, you're already overthinking. Winners decide fast and figure it out as they go. The only guarantee is that you'll be forced to confront why you're not winning.

### What happens after the 3-month cohort?
Alumni can continue month-to-month at their cohort rate (locked in). Many continue because the accountability becomes addictive. You also join the WIN CLUB alumni network - winners helping winners win.

### Why should I trust Sid?
- 15-year immigration journey (H1B → EB1-A → Green card)
- Built RenovateAI to $3M ARR while on H1B
- 1,400+ founders in the H1Founders community
- Shared the exact playbook publicly (see LinkedIn posts)
- Ships products, not courses

### How is this different from mastermind groups?
Masterminds are peer-led. WIN CLUB is mentor-led. You're not getting advice from people at your level; you're getting directed by someone who's already walked the path. No group calls where everyone shares feelings. Just execution.

### When does the next cohort start?
- Q1 2026: January 1st
- Q2 2026: April 1st  
- Q3 2026: July 1st
- Q4 2026: October 1st

Each cohort runs for 3 months. Apply 2 weeks before start date.

### Can I get a refund if it doesn't work?
No. This question reveals you're already planning to fail. WIN CLUB is for people who burn the boats. If you need an exit strategy, you're not ready for transformation.
