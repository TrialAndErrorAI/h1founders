```

## YouTube + Our Platform Strategy

### Why YouTube + Our Site
- **YouTube**: Discovery, ads revenue, comments
- **Our Site**: Control, data capture, enhanced experience
- **Best of both**: YouTube's reach + our intelligence layer

### Enhanced Player Features (MVP)
```html
<!-- Not just embedded YouTube -->
<div class="tough-love-player">
  <!-- YouTube iframe -->
  <iframe src="youtube.com/embed/[ID]" />
  
  <!-- Our overlay UI -->
  <div class="transcript-panel">
    <!-- Scrolling transcript -->
  </div>
  
  <div class="insights-bar">
    <!-- Key moments, quotes -->
  </div>
  
  <div class="cta-overlay">
    <!-- Apply for session -->
  </div>
</div>
```

## Transcript Integration (We Already Have)

### File Structure
```
/data/transcripts/
├── h1toughlove_sid-swap-aug-27-2025.txt
├── h1-toughlove_sid-akshyae-sep10-2025.txt
└── h1b-founders_tough-love-to-rana-sep-24-2025.txt
```

### Atlas Extraction (For MVP)
**Atlas/Claude processes each transcript UNIQUELY:**

Atlas reads the transcript and finds what ACTUALLY happened:
- What THIS founder struggled with
- What questions hit hardest for THEM
- When (if at all) breakthrough occurred
- What specific advice emerged
- The best quotes from THIS session

**No templates - just truth extraction**

### Display Format (Unique per Episode)
```
EPISODE 1 INTELLIGENCE (discovered by Atlas)
├── This Founder's Issue: [Whatever Atlas found]
├── Key Moment: [If there was one]
├── What Emerged: [Specific to this session]
├── Notable Quote: [Best from THIS session]
└── Atlas Note: [Any pattern if emerging]
```

**Example from real sessions:**
- Swapnil: Talked about email for 90 minutes, never defined product
- Akshya: Philosophy on helping vs money, no concrete example
- Rana: Said "talent-first" 50 times, meant nothing

Each completely different. Atlas finds what matters.

## MVP Tech Stack (For NEXUS)

2. **TranscriptViewer.tsx**: Synced text display
3. **InsightCard.tsx**: Extracted intelligence
